### Catalog Management

The Catalog tab in the web console will show all versions of catalog items,
and allow you to add new items.


#### Adding to the Catalog

On the UI the "add" button <img src="images/add-to-catalog.png" width="24" alt="add-to-catalog" /> at the top of the menu panel allows the
addition of new Applications to the catalog, via YAML, and of new Locations.

In addition to the GUI, items can be added to the catalog via the REST API
with a `POST` of the YAML file to `/v1/catalog` endpoint.
To do this using `curl`:

~~~ bash
curl -u admin:password http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/catalog --data-binary @/path/to/riak.catalog.bom
~~~ 

Or using the CLI:

~~~ bash
br catalog add /path/to/riak.catalog.bom
~~~ 



#### Deleting from the Catalog

On the UI, if an item is selected, a 'Delete' button in the detail panel can be used to delete it from the catalog.

Using the REST API, you can delete a versioned item from the catalog using the corresponding endpoint. 
For example, to delete the item with id `datastore` and version `1.0` with `curl`:

~~~ bash
curl -u admin:password -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/catalog/applications/datastore/1.0
~~~ 


**Note:** Catalog items should not be deleted if there are running apps which were created using the same item. 
During rebinding the catalog item is used to reconstruct the entity.

If you have running apps which were created using the item you wish to delete, you should instead deprecate the catalog item.
Deprecated catalog items will not appear in the add application wizard, or in the catalog list but will still
be available to Brooklyn for rebinding. The option to display deprecated catalog items in the catalog list will be added
in a future release.

Deprecation applies to a specific version of a catalog item, so the full
id including the version number is passed to the REST API as follows:

~~~ bash
curl -u admin:password -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8081/v1/catalog/entities/MySQL:1.0/deprecated/true
~~~
