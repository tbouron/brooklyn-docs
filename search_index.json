We recommend it as the easiest way of getting started with Apache Brooklyn.\nFirstly, download and install:\n\nVagrant{:target=\"_blank\"}\nOracle VirtualBox{:target=\"_blank\"}\n\nThen download the provided Apache Brooklyn vagrant configuration from\n[here](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua?action=download&filename=brooklyn/apache-brooklyn-NaN/apache-brooklyn-NaN-vagrant.tar.gz).\nThis archive contains everything you need to create an environment for use with this guide, providing an Apache Brooklyn instance and some blank VMs.\nExtract the tar.gz archive and navigate into the expanded apache-brooklyn-{{book.brooklyn-version}}-vagrant folder \n$ tar xvf apache-brooklyn-{{book.brooklyn-version}}-vagrant.tar.gz\n$ cd apache-brooklyn-{{book.brooklyn-version}}-vagrant\n\nFor Centos 7 and RHEL 7 users, the recommended way to install Apache Brooklyn on RPM-based Linux distributions is by using the RPM package. \nRPM is the de facto standard for packaging software on these Linux distributions and provides a mechanism for installing, upgrading and removing packages such as Apache Brooklyn. The RPM package contains all the necessary files associated with the Apache Brooklyn application. \nDownload the Apache Brooklyn RPM distribution{:target=\"_blank\"}.\nOnce downloaded, run the following shell command as root:\n$ yum install apache-brooklyn-{{book.brooklyn-version}}-1.rpm\n\nFor Ubuntu and Debian users, the recommended way to install Apache Brooklyn is to use the deb file. \nThe deb file is the de facto standard for packaging software on these Linux distributions and provides a mechanism for installing, upgrading and removing packages such as Apache Brooklyn. The deb package contains all the necessary files associated with the Apache Brooklyn application. \nDownload the Apache Brooklyn deb distribution{:target=\"_blank\"}.\nOnce downloaded, run the following shell command:\n$ sudo dpkg -i apache-brooklyn_{{book.brooklyn-version}}_noarch.deb\n\nFor Linux or OSX please download the Apache Brooklyn tar.gz archive from the download{:target=\"_blank\"} section.\nExtract the tar.gz archive and navigate into the expanded apache-brooklyn-{{ book.brooklyn-version }} folder.\n$ tar -zxf apache-brooklyn-{{ book.brooklyn-version }}-dist.tar.gz\n$ cd apache-brooklyn-{{ book.brooklyn.version }}\n\nFor all versions of Microsoft Windows, please download the Apache Brooklyn zip file from here{:target=\"_blank\"}. \nExtract this zip file to a directory on your computer such as c:\\Program Files\\brooklyn where c is the letter of your operating system drive.\n\n\n\nBy default, no authentication is required and the web-console will listen on all network interfaces.\nFor a production system, or if Apache Brooklyn is publicly reachable, it is strongly recommended \nto configure security. Documentation of configuration options include:\n\nSecurity\nPersistence\nCloud credentials\n\nLaunch Apache Brooklyn\nNow start Apache Brooklyn with the following command:\n$ vagrant up brooklyn\n\nYou can see if Apache Brooklyn launched OK by viewing the log files with the command\n$ vagrant ssh brooklyn --command 'sudo journalctl -n15 -f -u brooklyn'\n\nApache Brooklyn should now have been installed and be running as a system service. It can stopped and started with the standard systemctl commands:\n$ systemctl start|stop|restart|status brooklyn\n\nThe application should then output its logs to brooklyn.debug.log and brooklyn.info.log, please refer to the paths page for the locations of these.\nApache Brooklyn should now have been installed and be running as a system service. It can be stopped and started with the standard service commands:\n$ sudo service brooklyn start|stop|restart|status\n\nThe application should then output its logs to brooklyn.debug.log and brooklyn.info.log, please refer to the paths page for the locations of these.\nNow start Apache Brooklyn with the following command:\n$ bin/start\n\nThe application should then output its log to brooklyn.debug.log and brooklyn.info.log, please refer to the paths page for the locations of these.\nYou can now start Apache Brooklyn by running c:\\Program Files\\brooklyn\\bin\\start.bat\nThe application should then output its log into the console and also c:\\Program Files\\brooklyn\\data\\log\\brooklyn.debug.log and c:\\Program Files\\brooklyn\\data\\log\\brooklyn.info.log\n\nNotice! Before launching Apache Brooklyn, please check the date on the local machine.\nEven several minutes before or after the actual time could cause problems.\n\n\n\n\nControl Apache Brooklyn\nApache Brooklyn has a web console which can be used to control the application. The Brooklyn log will contain the \naddress of the management interface:\n\nINFO  Started Brooklyn console at http://127.0.0.1:8081/, running classpath://brooklyn.war\n\n\nBy default it can be accessed by opening 127.0.0.1:8081{:target=\"_blank\"} in your web browser.\nThe rest of this getting started guide uses the Apache Brooklyn command line interface (CLI) tool, br. \nThis tool is both distributed with Apache Brooklyn or can be downloaded \nusing the most appropriate link for your OS:\n\nWindows\nLinux\nOSX\n\nFor details on the CLI, see the Client CLI Reference page. \nNext\n\n\nThe first thing we want to do with Brooklyn is **[deploy a blueprint](/guide/start/blueprints.html)**.\n\n\n"},"start/blueprints.html":{"url":"start/blueprints.html","title":"Deploying Blueprints","keywords":"","body":"Blueprints are descriptors or patterns which describe how Apache Brooklyn should deploy applications. Blueprints are written in YAML{:target=\"blank\"} and many of the entities available are defined in the _Brooklyn Catalog.\nLaunching from a Blueprint\nWe'll start by deploying an application with a simple YAML blueprint containing an Apache Tomcat{:target=\"_blank\"} server.\nCopy the blueprint below into a text file, \"myapp.yaml\", in your workspace (Note, to copy the file you can\nhover your mouse over the right side of the text box below to get a Javascript \"copy\" button).\nname: Tomcat\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.tomcat.TomcatServer\n  name: tomcatServer\nlocation: \n\nLocations\nBefore you can create an application with this configuration, you need to modify the YAML to specify a location. Locations in Apache Brooklyn are server resources which Brooklyn can use to deploy applications. These locations may be servers or cloud providers which provide access to servers. \nIn order to configure the location in which Apache Brooklyn launches an application, replace the location: element with values for your chosen target environment. Here are some examples of the various location types:\n{::options parse_block_html=\"true\" /}\n\n    Vagrant\n    Clouds\n    BYON\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vagrant configuration described in [Running Apache Brooklyn](./running.html), on the previous page is the recommended way of running this tutorial. This configuration comes with four blank vagrant configurations called byon1 to byon4.\n\nThese can be launched by entering the following command into the terminal in the vagrant configuration directory.\n\n```bash\n $ vagrant up byon1 byon2 byon3 byon4\n```\n\nThe location in \"myapp.yaml\" can now be replaced with the following YAML to launch using these vagrant servers.\n\n```yaml\nlocation:\n  byon:\n    user: vagrant\n    password: vagrant\n    hosts:\n      - 10.10.10.101\n      - 10.10.10.102\n      - 10.10.10.103\n      - 10.10.10.104\n```\n\n\n\n\nApache Brooklyn uses [Apcahe jclouds](http://jclouds.apache.org/){:target=\"_blank\"} to support a range of cloud locations. More information on the range of providers and configurations is available [here](/guide/locations/#clouds){:target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nAs an example, here is a configuration for [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](http://www.aws.amazon.com){:target=\"_blank\"}. Swap the identity and credential with your AWS account details, then replace the location in your \"myapp.yaml\" with this.\n\n```yaml\nlocation:\n  jclouds:aws-ec2:\n    identity: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST\n    credential: s3cr3tsq1rr3ls3cr3tsq1rr3ls3cr3tsq1rr3l\n```\n\n\n\n\nThe Bring Your Own Nodes (BYON) configuration allows Apache Brooklyn to make use of already available servers. These can be specified by a list of IP addresses with a user and password as shown below. More information including the full range of configuration options is available [here](/guide/locations/#byon){:target=\"_blank\"}. \n\nReplace the hosts, user and password in the example below with your own server details, then replace the location in your \"myapp.yaml\" with this.\n\n```yaml\nlocation:\n  byon:\n    user: myuser\n    password: mypassword\n    # or...\n    #privateKeyFile: ~/.ssh/my.pem\n    hosts:\n    - 192.168.0.18\n    - 192.168.0.19\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: For instructions on setting up a variety of locations or storing credentials/locations in a file on disk rather than in the blueprint, see Locations in the Operations section of the User Guide.\nDeploying the Application\nFirst, log in to brooklyn with the command line interface (CLI) tool by typing:\n$ br login http://localhost:8081/\n\nTo secure the Apache Brooklyn instance, you can add a username and password to Brooklyn's properties file, as described in the User Guide here{:target=\"_blank\"}. \nIf this is configured, the login command will require an additional parameter for the userid and will then prompt for a password.\nNow you can create the application with the command below:\n$ br deploy myapp.yaml\n\n\nId:       hTPAF19s   \nName:     Tomcat   \nStatus:   In progress  \n\n\nDepending on your choice of location it may take some time for the application to start, the next page describes how \nyou can monitor the progress of the application deployment and verify if it was successful.\nNext\n\n\nHaving deployed an application, the next step is **[monitoring and managing](managing.html)** it.\n\n"},"start/managing.html":{"url":"start/managing.html","title":"Monitoring and Managing Applications","keywords":"","body":"So far we have gone through Apache Brooklyn's ability to deploy an application blueprint to a location, but this just \nthe beginning. Next we will outline how to manage the application that has been deployed.\nApplications\nHaving created the application, we can find a summary of all deployed applications using:\n$ br application\n\n\n Id         Name     Status    Location   \n hTPAF19s   Tomcat   RUNNING   ajVVAhER\n\n\napplication can be shortened to the alias app, for example:\n$ br app\n\n\n Id         Name     Status    Location   \n hTPAF19s   Tomcat   RUNNING   ajVVAhER\n\n\nA full list of abbreviations such as this can be found in the CLI reference guide{:target=\"_blank\"}.\nIn the above example the Id hTPAF19s and the Name Tomcat are shown.

You can list the available effectors for your application using:\n$ br application Tomcat effector\n\n\nName            Description                                           Parameters   \nrestart         Restart the process/service represented by an entity                                                                                                                                      \nstart           Start the process/service represented by an entity    locations   \nstop            Stop the process/service represented by an entity                                                                                                                                         \n\n\nFor example, to stop an application, use the stop effector. This will cleanly shutdown all components in the application and return any cloud machines that were being used. \nNote that the three \"lifecycle\" related effectors, start, stop, and restart, are common to all applications and software process entities in Brooklyn.\nYou can list the effectors for a specific entity using the command:\n$ br application Tomcat entity tomcatServer effector\n\n\nName                              Description                                                                               Parameters   \ndeploy                            Deploys the given artifact, from a source URL, to a given deployment filename/context     url,targetName   \npopulateServiceNotUpDiagnostics   Populates the attribute service.notUp.diagnostics, with any available health indicators      \nrestart                           Restart the process/service represented by an entity                                      restartChildren,restartMachine   \nstart                             Start the process/service represented by an entity                                        locations   \nstop                              Stop the process/service represented by an entity                                         stopProcessMode,stopMachineMode   \nundeploy                          Undeploys the given context/artifact                                                      targetName   \n\n\nTo view the details for a specific effector, append it's name to the command:\n$ br application Tomcat entity tomcatServer effector deploy\n\n\nName     Description                                                                             Parameters   \ndeploy   Deploys the given artifact, from a source URL, to a given deployment filename/context   url,targetName   \n\n\nThese effectors can also be invoked by appending invoke to this command. Some effectors require parameters for their invocation. For example, if we look at the details for deploy above we can see it requires a url and targetName. \nThese parameters can be supplied using --param parm=value or just -P parm=value. \nThe commands below deploy the Apache Tomcat hello world example{:target=\"_blank\"} to our Tomcat Server. In these commands, a variable is created for the root URL using the appropriate\nsensor and the index page html is displayed. \n$ br application Tomcat entity tomcatServer effector deploy invoke -P url=https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/appdev/sample/sample.war -P targetName=sample\n$ webapp=$(br application Tomcat entity tomcatServer sensor webapp.url | tr -d '\"')\n$ curl $webapp/sample/\n\n\n\nSample \"Hello, World\" Application\n\n...\nNote that at present a tr command is required in the second line below to strip quotation characters from the returned sensor value. \nActivities\nActivities are the actions an application or entity takes within Apache Brooklyn.

Resizing the \ncluster can either be carried out manually via effectors or automatically by attaching an \n`AutoScalerPolicy`.\n\nIt is configured with a `dynamiccluster.memberspec`, which defines the type and configurtion of members\nin the cluster. In our example, each is a Tomcat server with a WAR deployed at the root URL.\n\nDeploy the app:\n\n```bash\nbr deploy mycluster.yaml\n\n Id:       nGY58ZZN   \n Name:     Tomcat Cluster   \n Status:   In progress   \n\n\nAnd wait for the app to be running, viewing its state with:\nbr application\n\n\n Id         Name             Status    Location   \n nGY58ZZN   Tomcat Cluster   RUNNING   Mf0CJac6   \n\n\nYou can view the list of entities within the cluster with the command below (which drills into the \napplication named \"Tomcat Cluster\", then into its child entity named \"Cluster\", and then lists its\nentities):\nbr application \"Tomcat Cluster\" entity \"Cluster\" entity\n\n\n Id         Name            Type   \n dYfUvLIw   quarantine      org.apache.brooklyn.entity.group.QuarantineGroup   \n tOpMeYYr   Tomcat Server   org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.tomcat.TomcatServer   \n\n\nThe \"quarantine\" entity is used when Tomcat servers fail to start correctly - this entity is by \ndefault added to the quarantine group, where it can later be investigated. This can be disabled using\nthe configuration dynamiccluster.quarantineFailedEntities: false.\nTomcat auto-repair\nEach Tomcat entity has a ServiceFailureDetector enricher and a ServiceRestarter policy. \nAn enricher generates new events or sensor values (metrics) for the entity by modifying or \naggregating data from one or more other sensors. A policy coordinates the runtime management of \nentities by carrying out actions, initiated by specific triggers. Policies are often used to keep \nthe system in a healthy state, such as handling failures and auto-scaling.\nThe built-in functionality of the Tomcat entity is to use the \"service.state\" sensor to report \nits status. It will be \"on-fire\" when a failure is detected, or \"running\" when healthy, or one of\nthe other lifecycle states such as \"starting\", \"stopping\" or \"stopped\". \nThe ServiceFailureDetector enricher emits an \"Entity Failed\" event whenever a failure is detected, \nand similarly an \"Entity Recovered\" event when recovered. The configuration option \nserviceOnFireStabilizationDelay will suppress reporting of failure until the entity is detected \nas failed for the given duration. This is very useful so as not to over-react to temporary failures.\nThe ServiceRestarter policy attaches to an entity in order to restart the service on failure. Ifthere are subsequent failures within a configurable time interval, or if the restart fails, theservice entity is marked as failed and no futher restarts are attempted.\nTry killing the Tomcat process for one of the members in the cluster. The command below will kill\nTomcat on the vagrant VMs named \"byon1\" to \"byon4\":\nfor i in byon{1..4}; do\n  vagrant ssh ${i} --command 'ps aux | grep -i tomcat |  grep -v grep | awk '\\''{print $2}'\\'' | xargs kill -9'\ndone\n\nYou can view the state of the Tomcat server with the command below (which drills into theapplication named \"Tomcat Cluster\", then into its child entity named \"Cluster\", and then into thefirst member of the cluster named \"Tomcat Server\"):\nbr application \"Tomcat Cluster\" entity \"Cluster\" entity \"Tomcat Server\"\n\n\n Id:              tOpMeYYr   \n Name:            Tomcat Server   \n Status:          ON_FIRE   \n ServiceUp:       false   \n Type:            org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.tomcat.TomcatServer   \n CatalogItemId:   org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.tomcat.TomcatServer:0.0.0.SNAPSHOT   \n\n\n\nAfter the given stabilizationDelay, the Tomcat server will be automatically restarted.\nCluster auto-replace\nThe cluster has a ServiceReplacer policy. This attaches to a DynamicCluster and replaces a \nfailed member; if this fails, it sets the Cluster state to on-fire.\nTo simulate a terminal failure of a member, repeatedly kill the process (using the command \nabove).\nThe Tomcat server should be replaced by a new member of the cluster, and then the old failed member\nremoved.\nYou can view the list of Tomcat servers in the cluster with the command below (which drills into theapplication named \"Tomcat Cluster\", then into its child entity named \"Cluster\", and then lists the \nchild entities):\nbr application \"Tomcat Cluster\" entity \"Cluster\" entity\n\n\n Id         Name            Type   \n dYfUvLIw   quarantine      org.apache.brooklyn.entity.group.QuarantineGroup   \n tOpMeYYr   Tomcat Server   org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.tomcat.TomcatServer   \n mgoRpkKH   Tomcat Server   org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.tomcat.TomcatServer   \n\n\n\nAuto-scaling\nThe AutoScalerPolicy attaches to a Resizable entity (in this case the DynamicCluster) and \ndynamically adjusts its size in response to keeping a metric within a given range.

For further discussion of these concepts see The Theory Behind Brooklyn, and the detailed descriptions in Brooklyn Concepts.\nDeployment and Management Brooklyn is built for agile deployment of applications across cloud and other targets, and real-time autonomic management. \"Autonomic computing\" is the concept of components looking after themselves where possible (self-healing, self-optimizing, etc).\nBlueprints  A blueprint defines an application by specifying its components, such as processes, or combinations of processes across multiple machines and services. The blueprint also specifies the inter-relationships between the configurations of the components.\nEntities The central concept in a Brooklyn deployment is that of an entity. An entity represents a resource under management (individual machines or software processes) or logical collections of these. Entities are arranged hierarchically. They can have events, operations, and processing logic associated with them, and it is through this mechanism that the active management is delivered.\nApplications are the top level entities that are the parents of all other entities.\nConfiguration Entities can have arbitrary configuration values, which get inherited by their child entities. You can set global (Brooklyn-wide) properties in (~/.brooklyn/brooklyn.properties).  Common configuration keys have convenient aliases called \"flags\".\nSensors are the mechanism for entities to expose information for other entities to see.  Sensors from an entity can be subscribed to by other entities to track changes in the entity’s activity. Sensors can be updated, potentially frequently, by the entity or associated tasks.\nEffectors are the mechanism for entities to expose the operations that can be invoked on it by other entities.  The invoker is able to track the execution of that effector with tasks. \nLifecycle The management context of Brooklyn associates a \"lifecycle\" with Brooklyn entities.  Common operations are start, stop, and restart (whose meaning differs slightly for applications and processes; the details are in the concepts guide linked above).  Starting an application results in the start() operation being performed recursively (typically in parallel) on the application's children.\nTasks Lifecycle and other operations in Brooklyn are tracked as tasks. This allows current and past processing to be observed by operators, and processing to be managed across multiple management nodes.\nLocations can be defined in order to specify where the processes of an application will run.  Brooklyn supports different cloud providers and pre-prepared machines (including localhost), known as \"BYON\" (Bring Your Own Nodes).\nPolicies Policies perform the active management enabled by Brooklyn. Entities can have  Policy instances attached to them, which can subscribe to sensors from other entities or run periodically.  When they run they can perform calculations, look up other values, invoke effectors or emit sensor values from the entity with which they are associated.\nEnrichers These are mechanisms that subscribe to a sensor, or multiple sensors, and output a new sensor. For example, the enricher which sums a sensor across multiple entities (used to get the total requests-per-second for all the web servers in a cluster), and the enricher which calculates a 60-second rolling average.\n"},"misc/download.html":{"url":"misc/download.html","title":"Downloads","keywords":"","body":"Download Version NaN\n\n  \n    Download\n    File/Format\n    checksums (?)\n  \n  \n    Binary distributionServer & client\n    apache-brooklyn-NaN-bin.tar.gz\n    \n\n      SHA1\n  \n  \n    apache-brooklyn-NaN-bin.zip\n    \n\n      SHA1\n  \n  \n    RPM packageCentOS7, RHEL7, etc.\n    apache-brooklyn-NaN-1.noarch.rpm\n    \n\n      SHA1\n  \n  \n    DEB packageUbuntu, Debian, etc.\n    apache-brooklyn-NaN.all.deb\n    \n\n      SHA1\n  \n  \n    Client CLI only\n    apache-brooklyn-NaN-client-cli-linux.tar.gz\n    \n\n      SHA1\n  \n  \n    apache-brooklyn-NaN-client-cli-linux.zip\n    \n\n      SHA1\n  \n  \n    apache-brooklyn-NaN-client-cli-macosx.tar.gz\n    \n\n      SHA1\n  \n  \n    apache-brooklyn-NaN-client-cli-macosx.zip\n    \n\n      SHA1\n  \n  \n    apache-brooklyn-NaN-client-cli-windows.tar.gz\n    \n\n      SHA1\n  \n  \n    apache-brooklyn-NaN-client-cli-windows.zip\n    \n\n      SHA1\n  \n  \n    Source code\n    apache-brooklyn-NaN-src.tar.gz\n    \n\n      SHA1\n  \n  \n    apache-brooklyn-NaN-src.zip\n    \n\n      SHA1\n  \n\n\n\nRelease Notes\nRelease notes can be found here.\n\nMaven\nIf you use Maven, you can add Brooklyn with the following in your pom:\n  \n\n    \n        \n            org.apache.brooklyn\n            brooklyn-all\n            {{ book.brooklyn-version }}\n        \n    \n\nbrooklyn-all brings in all dependencies, including jclouds.\nIf you prefer a smaller repo you might want just brooklyn-core,  brooklyn-policies, \nand some of brooklyn-software-webapp,  brooklyn-software-database, brooklyn-software-messaging, or others\n(browse the full list here).\nIf you wish to use the Apache snapshot repo, you can add this to you pom.xml:\n\n    \n        \n            apache-nexus-snapshots\n            Apache Nexus Snapshots\n            https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots\n             false \n             true \n        \n    \n\n\nSource Code\nSource code is hosted at github.com/apache/brooklyn,\nwith this version in branch .\nThese locations have a README.md in the root which explains how to get the code including\nsubmodules.\nUseful information on working with the source is here.\n"},"concepts/entities.html":{"url":"concepts/entities.html","title":"Entities","keywords":"","body":"The central concept in a Brooklyn deployment is that of an entity. \nAn entity represents a resource under management, either base entities (individual machines or software processes) \nor logical collections of these entities.\nFundamental to the processing model is the capability of entities to be the parent of other entities (the mechanism by which collections are formed), \nwith every entity having a single parent entity, up to the privileged top-level application entity.\nEntities are code, so they can be extended, overridden, and modified.

This can contain arbitrary values, typically keyed under static ConfigKey fields on the Entity sub-class. These values are inherited, so setting a configuration value at the\napplication level will make it available in all entities underneath unless it is overridden.\nConfiguration is propagated when an application \"goes live\" (i.e. it becomes \"managed\", either explicitly or when its start() method is invoked), so config values must be set before this occurs. \nConfiguration values can be specified in a configuration file (brooklyn.cfg)\nto apply universally, and/or programmatically to a specific entity and its descendants \nby calling .configure(KEY, VALUE) in the entity spec when creating it.\nThere is also an entity.config().set(KEY, VALUE) method.\nAdditionally, many common configuration parameters are available as \"flags\" which can be supplied as Strings when constructing\nthen entity, in the form\nEntitySpec.create˙(MyEntity.class).configure(\"config1\", \"value1\").configure(\"config2\", \"value2\"). \nDocumentation of the flags available for individual entities can normally be found in the javadocs. \nThe @SetFromFlag annotations on ConfigKey static field definitions\nin the entity's interface is the recommended mechanism for exposing configuration options.\nSensors and Effectors\nSensors (activity information and notifications) and effectors (operations that can be invoked on the entity) are defined by entities as static fields on the Entity subclass.\nSensors can be updated by the entity or associated tasks, and sensors from an entity can be subscribed to by its parent or other entities to track changes in an entity's activity.\nEffectors can be invoked by an entity's parent remotely, and the invoker is able to track the execution of that effector. Effectors can be invoked by other entities, but use this functionality with care to prevent too many managers!\nAn entity consists of a Java interface (used when interacting with the entity) and a Java class. For resilience. it is recommended to store \nthe entity's state in attributes (see getAttribute(AttributeKey)).

For programmatic use, see \nBrooklynLauncher.newLauncher().launch().\nA Brooklyn deployment consists of many entities in a hierarchical tree, with the privileged application entity at the top level.\nAn application entity (Application class) is responsible for starting the deployment of all its child entities (i.e. the entire entity tree under its ownership).\nAn Application's start() method begins provisioning the child entities of the application (and their entities, recursively). \nProvisioning of entities typically happens in parallel automatically,\nalthough this can be customized. This is implemented as tasks which are tracked by the management plane and is accessible in the web-based management console and REST API.\nCustomized provisioning can be useful where two starting entities depend on each other. For example, it is often necessary to delay start of one entity until another entity reaches a certain state, and to supply run-time information about the latter to the former.\n\nWhen new entities are created, the entity is wired up to an application by giving it a parent. The entity is then explicitly \"managed\", which allows other entities to discover it.\nTypically a Brooklyn deployment has a single management context which records:\n\nall entities under management that are reachable by the application(s) via the parent-child relationships,\nthe state associated with each entity,\nsubscribers (listeners) to sensor events arising from the entities,\nactive tasks (jobs) associated with any the entity,\nwhich Brooklyn management node is mastering (managing) each entity.\n\n\nIn a multi-location deployment, management operates in all regions, with brooklyn entity instances being mastered in the relevant region.\nWhen management is distributed a Brooklyn deployment may consist of multiple Brooklyn management nodes each with a ManagementContext instance.\n\n"},"concepts/dependent-configuration.html":{"url":"concepts/dependent-configuration.html","title":"Dependent Configuration","keywords":"","body":"Under the covers Brooklyn has a sophisticated sensor event and subscription model, but conveniences around this model make it very simple to express cross-entity dependencies.

As soon as the database URL is announced by the MySql entity, the configuration value will be available to the Tomcat cluster. \nBy default \"ready\" means being set (non-null) and, if appropriate, non-empty (for collections and strings) or non-zero (for numbers). Formally the interpretation of ready is that of \"Groovy truth\" defined by an asBoolean() method on the class and in the Groovy language extensions. \nYou can customize \"readiness\" by supplying a Predicate (Google common) or Closure (Groovy) in a third parameter. \nThis evaluates candidate values reported by the sensor until one is found to be true. \nFor example, passing { it.size()>=3 } as the readiness argument would require at least three management plane URLs.\nMore information on this can be found in the javadoc for DependentConfiguration,\nalong with a few other methods such as valueWhenAttributeReady which allow post-processing of an attribute value.\nNote that if the value of CONFIG_KEY passed to Entity.getConfig is a Closure or Task (such as returned by attributeWhenReady),\nthe first access of Entity.getConfig(CONFIG_KEY) will block until the task completes.\nTypically this does the right thing, blocking when necessary to generate the right start-up sequence\nwithout the developer having to think through the order, but it can take some getting used to.\nBe careful not to request config information until really necessary (or to use non-blocking \"raw\" mechanisms),\nand in complicated situations be ready to attend to circular dependencies.\nThe management console gives useful information for understanding what is happening and resolving the cycle.\n"},"concepts/location.html":{"url":"concepts/location.html","title":"Location","keywords":"","body":"\nEntities can be provisioned/started in the location of your choice.

When writing the application definition specify the location or list of possible locations (Location instances) for hosting the entity.\nLocation instances represent where they run and indicate how that location (resource or service) can be accessed.\nFor example, a JBoss7Server will usually be running in an SshMachineLocation, which contains the credentials and address for sshing to the machine.

However, that approach is discouraged as it does not work in all contexts\nsuch as for inheriting configuration from a parent entity.\nConfiguration in a Catalog Item\nWhen defining an entity in the catalog, it can include configuration values like any other \nblueprint (i.e. inside the brooklyn.config block).\nIt can also explicitly declare config keys, using the brooklyn.parameters block. The example \nbelow illustrates the principle:\nbrooklyn.catalog:\n  items:\n  - id: entity-config-example\n    itemType: entity\n    name: Entity Config Example\n    item:\n      type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.VanillaSoftwareProcess\n      brooklyn.parameters:\n      - name: custom.message\n        type: string\n        description: Message to be displayed\n        default: Hello\n      brooklyn.config:\n        shell.env:\n          MESSAGE: $brooklyn:config(\"custom.message\")\n        launch.command: |\n          echo \"My example launch command: $MESSAGE\"\n        checkRunning.command: |\n          echo \"My example checkRunning command: $MESSAGE\"\n\nOnce added to the catalog, it can be used with the simple blueprint below (substituting the location\nof your choice). Because no configuration has been overridden, this will use the default value\nfor custom.message, and will use the given values for launch.command and checkRunning.command:\nlocation: aws-ec2:us-east-1\nservices:\n- type: entity-config-example\n\nFor details of how to write and add catalog items, see Catalog. \nConfig Key Constraints\nThe config keys in the brooklyn.parameters can also have constraints defined, for what values\nare valid. If more than one constraint is defined, then they must all be satisfied. The constraints \ncan be any of:\n\nrequired: deployment will fail if no value is supplied for this config key.\nregex: ...: the value will be compared against the given regular expression.\nA predicate, declared using the DSL $brooklyn:object.  \n\nThis is illustrated in the example below:\nbrooklyn.catalog:\n  items:\n  - id: entity-constraint-example\n    itemType: entity\n    name: Entity Config Example\n    item:\n      type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.stock.BasicEntity\n      brooklyn.parameters:\n      - name: compulsoryExample\n        type: string\n        constraints:\n        - required\n      - name: addressExample\n        type: string\n        constraints:\n        - regex: ^(?:[0-9]{1,3}\\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}$\n      - name: numberExample\n        type: double\n        constraints:\n        - $brooklyn:object:\n            type: org.apache.brooklyn.util.math.MathPredicates\n            factoryMethod.name: greaterThan\n            factoryMethod.args:\n            - 0.0\n        - $brooklyn:object:\n            type: org.apache.brooklyn.util.math.MathPredicates\n            factoryMethod.name: lessThan\n            factoryMethod.args:\n            - 256.0\n\nAn example usage of this toy example, once added to the catalog, is shown below:\nservices:\n- type: entity-constraint-example\n  brooklyn.config:\n    compulsoryExample: foo\n    addressExample: 1.1.1.1\n    numberExample: 2.0\n\nInheriting Configuration\nConfiguration can be inherited from a super-type, and from a parent entity in the runtime \nmanagement hierarchy. This applies to entities and locations. In a future release, this will be\nextended to also apply to policies and enrichers.\nWhen a blueprint author defines a config key, they can explicitly specify the rules for inheritance \n(both for super/sub-types, and for the runtime management hiearchy). This gives great flexibilty,\nbut should be used with care so as not to surprise users of the blueprint.\nThe default behaviour is outlined below, along with examples and details of how to explilcitly \ndefine the desired behaviour.\nNormal Configuration Precedence\nThere are several places that a configuration value can come from. If different values are \nspecified in multiple places, then the order of precedence is as listed below:\n\nConfiguration on the entity itself\nInherited configuration from the super-type\nInherited configuration from the runtime type hierarchy\nThe config key's default value\n\nInheriting Configuration from Super-type\nWhen using an entity from the catalog, its configuration values can be overridden. For example,\nconsider the entity-config-example added to the catalog in the section \nConfiguration in a Catalog Item.\nWe can override these values. If not overridden, then the existing values from the super-type will be used:\nlocation: aws-ec2:us-east-1\nservices:\n- type: entity-config-example\n  brooklyn.config:\n    custom.message: Goodbye\n    launch.command: |\n      echo \"Sub-type launch command: $MESSAGE\"\n\nIn this example, the custom.message overrides the default defined on the config key.\nThe launch.command overrides the original command. The other config (e.g. checkRunning.command)\nis inherited unchanged.\nIt will write out: Sub-type launch command: Goodbye.\nInheriting Configuration from a Parent in the Runtime Management Hieararchy\nConfiguration passed to an entity is inherited by all child entities, unless explicitly overridden.\nIn the example below, the wars.root config key is inherited by all TomcatServer entities created\nunder the cluster, so they will use that war:\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.group.DynamicCluster\n  brooklyn.config:\n    wars.root: http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/apache/brooklyn/example/brooklyn-example-hello-world-webapp/0.9.0/brooklyn-example-hello-world-webapp-0.9.0.war\n    dynamiccluster.memberspec:\n      $brooklyn:entitySpec:\n        type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.tomcat.TomcatServer\n\nIn the above example, it would be better to have specified the wars.root configuration in the \nTomcatServer entity spec, rather than at the top level. This would make it clearer for the reader\nwhat is actually being configured.\nThe technique of inherited config can simplify some blueprints, but care should be taken. \nFor more complex (composite) blueprints, this can be difficult to use safely; it relies on \nknowledge of the internals of the child components. For example, the inherited config \nmay impact multiple sub-components, rather than just the specific entity to be changed.\nThis is particularly true when using complex items from the catalog, and when using common config \nvalues (e.g. install.version).\nAn alternative approach is to declare the expected configuration options at the top level of the\ncatalog item, and then (within the catalog item) explicitly inject those values into the correct\nsub-components. Users of this catalog item would set only those exposed config options, rather \nthan trying to inject config directly into the nested entities.\nDSL Evaluation of Inherited Config\nWhen writing blueprints that rely on inheritance from the runtime management hierarchy, it is \nimportant to  understand how config keys that use DSL will be evaluated. In particular, when \nevaluating a DSL expression, it will be done in the context of the entity declaring the config \nvalue (rather than on the entity using the config value).\nFor example, consider the config value $brooklyn:attributeWhenReady(\"host.name\")\ndeclared on entity X, and inherited by child entity Y. If entity Y uses this config value, \nit will get the \"host.name\" attribute of entity X.\nBelow is another (contrived!) example of this DSL evaluation. When evaluating refExampleConfig,\nit retrievies the value of exampleConfig which is the DSL expression, and evaluates this in the \ncontext of the parent entity that declares it. Therefore $brooklyn:config(\"ownConfig\") returns \nthe parent's ownConfig value, and the final result for refExampleConfig is set to \"parentValue\":\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.stock.BasicApplication\n  brooklyn.config:\n    ownConfig: parentValue\n    exampleConfig: $brooklyn:config(\"ownConfig\")\n\n  brooklyn.children:\n  - type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.stock.BasicEntity\n    brooklyn.config:\n      ownConfig: childValue\n      refExampleConfig: $brooklyn:config(\"exampleConfig\")\n\nHowever, the web-console also shows other misleading (incorrect!) config values for the child \nentity. It shows the inherited config value of exampleConfig as \"childValue\" (because the\nREST api did not evaluate the DSL in the correct context, when retrieving the value! \nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BROOKLYN-455.\nMerging Configuration Values\nFor some configuration values, the most logical behaviour is to merge the configuration value\nwith that in the super-type. This depends on the type and meaning of the config key, and is thus \nan option when defining the config key.\nCurrently it is only supported for merging config keys of type Map.\nSome common config keys will default to merging the values from the super-type. These config keysinclude those below. The value is merged with that of its super-type (but will not be merged with \nthe value on a parent entity):\n\nshell.env: a map of environment variables to pass to the runtime shell\nfiles.preinstall: a mapping of files, to be copied before install, to destination name relative to installDir\ntemplates.preinstall: a mapping of templates, to be filled in and copied before pre-install, to destination name relative to installDir \nfiles.install: a mapping of files, to be copied before install, to destination name relative to installDir \ntemplates.install: a mapping of templates, to be filled in and copied before install, to destination name relative to installDir \nfiles.runtime: a mapping of files, to be copied before customisation, to destination name relative to runDir \ntemplates.runtime: a mapping of templates, to be filled in and copied before customisation, to destination name relative to runDir \nprovisioning.properties: custom properties to be passed in when provisioning a new machine\n\nA simple example of merging shell.env is shown below (building on the entity-config-example in \nthe section Configuration in a Catalog Item).\nThe environment variables will include the MESSAGE \nset in the super-type and the MESSAGE2 set here:\nlocation: aws-ec2:us-east-1\nservices:\n- type: entity-config-example\n  brooklyn.config:\n    shell.env:\n      MESSAGE2: Goodbye\n    launch.command: |\n      echo \"Different example launch command: $MESSAGE and $MESSAGE2\"\n\nTo explicitly remove a value from the super-type's map (rather than adding to it), a blank entry\ncan be defined. \nEntity provisioning.properties: Overriding and Merging\nAn entity (which extends SoftwareProcess) can define a map of provisioning.properties. If \nthe entity then provisions a location, it passes this map of properties to the location for\nobtaining the machine. These properties will override and augment the configuration on the location\nitself.\nWhen deploying to a jclouds location, one can specify templateOptions (of type map). Rather than\noverriding, these will be merged with any templateOptions defined on the location.\nIn the example below, the VM will be provisioned with minimum 2G ram and minimum 2 cores. It will \nalso use the merged template options value of \n{placementGroup: myPlacementGroup, securityGroupIds: sg-000c3a6a}:\nlocation:\n  aws-ec2:us-east-1:\n    minRam: 2G\n    templateOptions:\n      placementGroup: myPlacementGroup\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.machine.MachineEntity\n  brooklyn.config:\n    provisioning.properties:\n      minCores: 2\n      templateOptions:\n        securityGroupIds: sg-000c3a6a\n\nThe merging of templateOptions is shallow (i.e. maps within the templateOptions are not merged). \nIn the example below, the userMetadata value within templateOptions will be overridden by the \nentity's value, rather than the maps being merged; the value used when provisioning will be \n{key2: val2}:\nlocation:\n  aws-ec2:us-east-1:\n    templateOptions:\n      userMetadata:\n        key1: val1\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.machine.MachineEntity\n  brooklyn.config:\n    provisioning.properties:\n      userMetadata:\n        key2: val2\n\nRe-inherited Versus not Re-inherited\nFor some configuration values, the most logical behaviour is for an entity to \"consume\" the config\nkey's value, and thus not pass it down to children in the runtime type hierarchy. This is called\n\"not re-inherited\".\nSome common config keys that will not re-inherited include:\n\ninstall.command (and the pre.install.command and post.install.command) \ncustomize.command (and the pre.customize.command and post.customize.command)\nlaunch.command (and the `pre.launch.command and post.launch.command)\ncheckRunning.command\nstop.command\nThe similar commands for VanillaWindowsProcess powershell.\nThe file and template install config keys (e.g. files.preinstall, templates.preinstall, etc)\n\nAn example is shown below. Here, the \"logstash-child\" is a sub-type of VanillaSoftwareProcess,\nand is co-located on the same VM as Tomcat. We don't want the Tomcat's configuration, such as \ninstall.command, to be inherited by the logstash child. If it was inherited, the logstash-child\nentity might re-execute the Tomcat's install command! Instead, the install.command config is\n\"consumed\" by the Tomcat instance and is not re-inherited:\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.tomcat.Tomcat8Server\n  brooklyn.config:\n    children.startable.mode: background_late\n  brooklyn.children:\n  - type: logstash-child\n    brooklyn.config:\n      logstash.elasticsearch.host: $brooklyn:entity(\"es\").attributeWhenReady(\"urls.http.withBrackets\")\n...\n\n\"Not re-inherited\" differs from \"never inherited\". The example below illustrates the difference, \nthough this use is discouraged (it is mostly for backwards compatibility). The post.install.command\nis not consumed by the BasicApplication, so will be inherited by the Tomcat8Server which will\nconsume it. The config value will therefore not be inherited by the logstash-child.\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.stock.BasicApplication\n  brooklyn.config:\n    post.install.command: echo \"My post.install command\"\n  brooklyn.children:\n  - type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.tomcat.Tomcat8Server\n    brooklyn.config:\n      children.startable.mode: background_late\n    brooklyn.children:\n    - type: logstash-child\n      brooklyn.config:\n        logstash.elasticsearch.host: $brooklyn:entity(\"es\").attributeWhenReady(\"urls.http.withBrackets\")\n...\n\nNever Inherited\nFor some configuration values, the most logical behaviour is for the value to never be inherited\nin the runtime management hiearchy.\nSome common config keys that will never inherited include:\n\ndefaultDisplayName: this is the name to use for the entity, if an explicit name is not supplied.\nThis is particularly useful when adding an entity in a catalog item (so if the user does not give\na name, it will get a sensible default). It would not be intuitive for all the children of that\nentity to also get that default name.\n\nid: the id of an entity (as supplied in the YAML, to allow references to that entity) is not \ninherited. It is the id of that specific entity, so must not be shared by all its children.\n\n\nInheritance Modes: Deep Dive\nThe javadoc in the code is useful for anyone who wants to go deep! See\norg.apache.brooklyn.config.BasicConfigInheritance and org.apache.brooklyn.config.ConfigInheritances\nin the repo https://github.com/apache/brooklyn-server.\nWhen defining a new config key, the exact semantics for inheritance can be defined. There are \nseparate options to control config inheritance from the super-type, and config inheritance from the\nparent in the runtime management hierarchy.\nThe possible modes are:\n\nNEVER_INHERITED: indicates that a key's value should never be inherited (even if defined on \nan entity that does not know the key). Most usages will prefer NOT_REINHERITED.\n\nNOT_REINHERITED: indicates that a config key value (if used) should not be passed down to\nchildren / sub-types. Unlike NEVER_INHERITED, these values can be passed down if they are not\nused by the entity (i.e. if the entity does not expect it). However, when used by a child,\nit will not be passed down any further. If the inheritor also defines a value the parent's \nvalue is ignored irrespective  (as in OVERWRITE; see NOT_REINHERITED_ELSE_DEEP_MERGE if merging \nis desired).\n\nNOT_REINHERITED_ELSE_DEEP_MERGE: as NOT_REINHERITED but in cases where a value is inherited \nbecause a parent did not recognize it, if the inheritor also defines a value the two values should \nbe merged.\n\nOVERWRITE: indicates that if a key has a value at both an ancestor and a descendant, the \ndescendant and his descendants will prefer the value at the descendant.\n\nDEEP_MERGE: indicates that if a key has a value at both an ancestor and a descendant, the \ndescendant and his descendants should attempt to merge the values. If the values are not mergable,\nbehaviour is undefined (and often the descendant's value will simply overwrite).\n\n\nExplicit Inheritance Modes\nThe YAML support for explicitly defining the inheritance mode is still work-in-progress. The options\ndocumented below will be enhanced in a future version of Brooklyn, to better support the modes described\nabove.\nIn a YAML blueprint, within the brooklyn.parameters section for declaring new config keys, one can\nset the mode for inheritance.type and inheritance.parent (i.e. for inheritance from the super-type, and\ninheritance in the runtime management hierarchy). The possible values are:\n\ndeep_merge: the inherited and the given value should be merged; maps within the map will also be merged\nalways: the inherited value should be used, unless explicitly overridden by the entity\nnone: the value should not be inherited; if there is no explicit value on the entity then the default value will be used\n\nBelow is a (contrived!) example of inheriting the example.map config key. When using this entity\nin a blueprint, the entity's config will be merged with that defined in the super-type, and the \nparent entity's value will never be inherited:\nbrooklyn.catalog:\n  items:\n  - id: entity-config-inheritance-example\n    version: \"1.1.0-SNAPSHOT\"\n    itemType: entity\n    name: Entity Config Inheritance Example\n    item:\n      type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.machine.MachineEntity\n      brooklyn.parameters:\n      - name: example.map\n        type: java.util.Map\n        inheritance.type: deep_merge\n        inheritance.parent: none\n        default:\n          MESSAGE_IN_DEFAULT: InDefault\n      brooklyn.config:\n        example.map:\n          MESSAGE: Hello\n\nThe blueprints below demonstrate the various permutations for setting configuration for the\nconfig example.map. This can be inspected by looking at the entity's config. The config\nwe see for app1 is the inherited {MESSAGE: \"Hello\"}; in app2 we define additional configuration,\nwhich will be merged to give {MESSAGE: \"Hello\", MESSAGE_IN_CHILD: \"InChild\"}; in app3, the \nconfig from the parent is not inherited because there is an explicit inheritance.parent of \"none\",\nso it just has the value {MESSAGE: \"Hello\"}; in app4 again the parent's config is ignored,\nwith the super-type and entity's config being merged to give  {MESSAGE: \"Hello\", MESSAGE_IN_CHILD: \"InChild\"}.\nlocation: aws-ec2:us-east-1\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.stock.BasicApplication\n  name: app1\n  brooklyn.children:\n  - type: entity-config-inheritance-example\n\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.stock.BasicApplication\n  name: app2\n  brooklyn.children:\n  - type: entity-config-inheritance-example\n    brooklyn.config:\n      example.map:\n        MESSAGE_IN_CHILD: InChild\n\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.stock.BasicApplication\n  name: app3\n  brooklyn.config:\n    example.map:\n      MESSAGE_IN_PARENT: InParent\n  brooklyn.children:\n  - type: entity-config-inheritance-example\n\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.stock.BasicApplication\n  name: app4\n  brooklyn.config:\n    example.map:\n      MESSAGE_IN_PARENT: InParent\n  brooklyn.children:\n  - type: entity-config-inheritance-example\n    brooklyn.config:\n      example.map:\n        MESSAGE_IN_CHILD: InChild\n\nA limitations of inheritance.parent is when inheriting values from parent and grandparent \nentities: a value specified on the parent will override (rather than be merged with) the\nvalue on the grandparent.\nMerging Policy and Enricher Configuration Values\nA current limitation is that sub-type inheritance is not supported for configuration of\npolicies and enrichers. The current behaviour is that config is not inherited. The concept of\ninheritance from the runtime management hierarchy does not apply for policies and enrichers\n(they do not have \"parents\"; they are attached to an entity).\n"},"blueprints/setting-locations.html":{"url":"blueprints/setting-locations.html","title":"Setting Locations","keywords":"","body":"Brooklyn supports a very wide range of target locations. \nWith deep integration to Apache jclouds, most well-known clouds \nand cloud platforms are supported.

Alternatively, it can be split to have one\nconfiguration option per line (recommended for all but the simplest locations).\nFor example, the two examples below are equivalent:\nlocation: byon(name=\"my loc\",hosts=\"1.2.3.4\",user=\"bob\",privateKeyFile=\"~/.ssh/bob_id_rsa\")\n\nlocation:\n  byon:\n    name: \"my loc\"\n    hosts:\n    - \"1.2.3.4\"\n    user: \"bob\"\n    privateKeyFile: \"~/.ssh/bob_id_rsa\"\n\nSpecific Locations for Specific Entities\nOne can define specific locations on specific entities within the blueprint (instead of, or as \nwell as, defining the location at the top-level of the blueprint).\nThe example below will deploy Tomcat and JBoss App Server to different Bring Your Own Nodes\nlocations:\nname: simple-appserver-with-location-per-entity\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.tomcat.Tomcat8Server\n  location:\n    byon(hosts=\"192.168.0.18\",user=\"brooklyn\",privateKeyFile=\"~/.ssh/brooklyn.pem\")\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.jboss.JBoss7Server\n  location:\n    byon(hosts=\"192.168.0.19\",user=\"brooklyn\",privateKeyFile=\"~/.ssh/brooklyn.pem\")\n\nThe rules for precedence when defining a location for an entity are:\n\nThe location defined on that specific entity.\nIf no location is defined, then the first ancestor that defines an explicit location.\nIf still no location is defined, then the location defined at the top-level of the blueprint.\n\nThis means, for example, that if you define an explicit location on a cluster then it will be used \nfor all members of that cluster.\nMultiple Locations\nSome entities are written to expect a set of locations.

Is there something about Maria?\nOne of the modular principles we follow in Brooklyn is substitutability:\nin many cases, the config keys, sensors, and effectors are defined\nin superclasses and are portable across multiple implementations.\nHere's an example deploying the same application but with different flavors of the components:\nname: appserver-w-db-other-flavor\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.tomcat.TomcatServer\n  name: AppServer HelloWorld \n  brooklyn.config:\n    wars.root: http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/apache/brooklyn/example/brooklyn-example-hello-world-sql-webapp/0.8.0-incubating/brooklyn-example-hello-world-sql-webapp-0.8.0-incubating.war\n    http.port: 8080+\n    java.sysprops: \n      brooklyn.example.db.url:\n        $brooklyn:formatString:\n          - jdbc:%s%s?user=%s\\\\&password=%s\n          - $brooklyn:component(\"db\").attributeWhenReady(\"datastore.url\")\n          - visitors\n          - brooklyn\n          - $brooklyn:external(\"brooklyn-demo-sample\", \"hidden-brooklyn-password\")\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.database.mariadb.MariaDbNode\n  id: db\n  name: DB HelloWorld Visitors\n  brooklyn.config:\n    creation.script.password: $brooklyn:external(\"brooklyn-demo-sample\", \"hidden-brooklyn-password\")\n    datastore.creation.script.url: https://github.com/apache/brooklyn-library/raw/master/examples/simple-web-cluster/src/main/resources/visitors-creation-script.sql\n    provisioning.properties:\n      minRam: 8192\n\nBy changing two lines we've switched from JBoss and MySQL to Tomcat and MariaDB.\nWe've also brought in the provisioning.properties from the VM example earlier\nso our database has 8GB RAM.\nAny of those properties, including imageId and user, can be defined on a per-entity basis.\n"},"blueprints/custom-entities.html":{"url":"blueprints/custom-entities.html","title":"Custom Entities","keywords":"","body":"So far we've covered how to configure and compose entities.\nThere's a large library of blueprints available, but\nthere are also times when you'll want to write your own.\nFor complex use cases, you can write JVM, but for many common situations,\nsome of the highly-configurable blueprints make it easy to write in YAML,\nincluding bash and Chef.\nVanilla Software using bash\nThe following blueprint shows how a simple script can be embedded in the YAML\n(the | character is special YAML which makes it easier to insert multi-line text):\nname: Simple Netcat Server Example\nlocation: localhost\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.VanillaSoftwareProcess\n  name: Simple Netcat Server\n  brooklyn.config:\n    launch.command: |\n      echo hello | nc -l 4321 &\n      echo $! > $PID_FILE\n\nThis starts a simple nc listener on port 4321 which will respond hello to the first\nsession which connects to it. Test it by running telnet localhost 4321\nor opening http://localhost:4321 in a browser.\nNote that it only allows you connect once, and after that it fails.\nThis is deliberate! We'll repair this later in this example.\nUntil then however, in the Applications view you can click the server,\ngo to the Effectors tab, and click restart to bring if back to life.  \nThis is just a simple script, but it shows how any script can be easily embedded here,\nincluding a script to download and run other artifacts.\nMany artifacts are already packaged such that they can be downloaded and launched \nwith a simple script, and VanillaSoftwareProcess can also be used for them. \nDownloading Files\nWe can specify a download.url which downloads an artifact \n(and automatically unpacking TAR, TGZ, and ZIP archives)\nbefore running launch.command relative to where that file is installed (or unpacked),\nwith the default launch.command being ./start.sh.\nSo if we create a file /tmp/netcat-server.tgz containing just start.sh in the root\nwhich contains the line echo hello | nc -l 4321, \nwe can instead write our example as: \nname: Simple Netcat Example From File\nlocation: localhost\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.VanillaSoftwareProcess\n  name: Simple Netcat Server\n  brooklyn.config:\n    download.url: file:///tmp/netcat-server.tgz\n    launch.command: |\n      ./start.sh &\n      echo $! > $PID_FILE\n\nDetermining Successful Launch\nThe default method used to determine a successful launch of VanillaSoftwareProcess is to run a \ncommand over ssh to do a health check. The health check is done post-launch (repeating until it \nsucceeds, before then reporting that the entity has started).\nThe default command used to carry out this health check will determine if the pid, written to \n$PID_FILE is running. This is why we included in the entity's launch script the line \necho $! > $PID_FILE.\nYou'll observe this if you connect to one of the netcat services (e.g. via telnet localhost 4321):\nthe nc process exits afterwards, causing Brooklyn to set the entity to an ON_FIRE state.\n(You can also test this with a killall nc).\nThere are other options for determining health: you can set checkRunning.command and stop.command instead,\nas documented on the javadoc and config keys of the\norg.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.VanillaSoftwareProcess\nclass, and those scripts will be used instead of checking and stopping the process whose PID is in $PID_FILE. For example:\nname: Netcat Example with Explicit Check and Stop Commands\nlocation: localhost\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.VanillaSoftwareProcess\n  name: Simple Netcat Server\n  brooklyn.config:\n    launch.command: |\n      echo hello | nc -l 4321 &\n      echo $! > $PID_FILE\n\n    # The following overrides demonstrate the use of a custom shell environment as well as\n    # check-running and stop commands. These are optional; default behavior will \"do the\n    # right thing\" with the pid file automatically.\n\n    shell.env:\n      CHECK_MARKER: \"checkRunning\"\n      STOP_MARKER: \"stop\"\n    checkRunning.command: |\n      echo $CHECK_MARKER >> DATE && test -f \"$PID_FILE\" && ps -p `cat $PID_FILE` >/dev/null\n    stop.command: |\n      echo $STOP_MARKER  >> DATE && test -f \"$PID_FILE\" && { kill -9 `cat $PID_FILE`; rm $PID_FILE; }\n\nPeriodic Health Check\nAfter start-up is complete, the health check described above is also run periodically, defaulting \nto every 5 seconds (configured with the config key softwareProcess.serviceProcessIsRunningPollPeriod).\nThis ssh-based polling can be turned off by configuring sshMonitoring.enabled: false. However, if \nno alternative health-check is defined then failure of the process would never be detected by Brooklyn.\nSee Health Check Sensors for alternative ways of detecting failures.\nPort Inferencing\nIf you're deploying to a cloud machine, a firewall might block the port 4321.\nWe can tell Brooklyn to open this port explicitly by specifying inboundPorts: [ 4321 ];\nhowever a more idiomatic way is to specify a config ending with .port,\nsuch as:\nname: Netcat Example with Port Opened\nlocation: localhost\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.VanillaSoftwareProcess\n  name: Simple Netcat Server\n\n  brooklyn.config:\n    # matching the regex `.*\\.port` will cause the port to be opened\n    # if in a cloud where configurable security groups are available\n    netcat.port: 4321\n\n    launch.command: |\n      echo hello | nc -l 4321 &\n      echo $! > $PID_FILE\n\nThe regex for ports to be opened can be configured using\nthe config inboundPorts.configRegex (which has .*\\.port as the default value).\nConfig keys of type org.apache.brooklyn.api.location.PortRange (aka port)\nhave special behaviour: when configuring, you can use range notation 8000-8100 or 8000+ to tell Brooklyn\nto find one port matching; this is useful when ports might be in use.\nIn addition, any such config key will be opened, \nirrespective of whether it matches the inboundPorts.configRegex. \nTo prevent any inferencing of ports to open, you can set the config inboundPorts.autoInfer to false.\nFurthermore, the port inferencing capability takes in account static ConfigKey fields that\nare defined on any Entity sub-class. So, ConfigKey fields that are based on PortRanges type will\nbe also included as required open ports.\nNote that in the example above, netcat.port must be specified in a brooklyn.config block.\nThis block can be used to hold any config (including for example the launch.command),\nbut for convenience Brooklyn allows config keys declared on the underlying type\nto be specified up one level, alongside the type.\nHowever config keys which are not declared on the type must be declared in the brooklyn.config block. \nPassing custom variables\nBlueprint scripts can be parametrised through environment variables, making them reusable in different use-cases.\nDefine the variables in the env block and then reference them using the standard bash notation:\nname: Netcat Example with Environment Vars\nlocation: localhost\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.VanillaSoftwareProcess\n  name: Simple Netcat Server\n\n  brooklyn.config:\n    launch.command: |\n      echo $MESSAGE | nc -l $NETCAT_PORT &\n      echo $! > $PID_FILE\n\n    shell.env:\n      MESSAGE: hello\n      NETCAT_PORT: 4321\n\nNon-string objects in the env map will be serialized to JSON before passing them to the script.\nDeclaring New Config Keys\nWe can define config keys to be presented to the user \nusing the brooklyn.parameters block:\nname: Netcat Example with Parameter\nlocation: localhost\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.VanillaSoftwareProcess\n  name: Simple Netcat Server\n  brooklyn.config:\n    launch.command: |\n      echo $MESSAGE | nc -l $NETCAT_PORT &\n      echo $! > $PID_FILE\n\n    shell.env:\n      MESSAGE: $brooklyn:config(\"message\")\n      NETCAT_PORT: $brooklyn:attributeWhenReady(\"netcat.port\")\n\n  brooklyn.parameters:\n  - name: message\n    description: a message to send to the caller\n    default: hello\n  - name: netcat.port\n    type: port\n    description: the port netcat should run on\n    default: 4321+\n\nThe example above will allow a user to specify a message to send back\nand the port where netcat will listen.\nThe metadata on these parameters is available at runtime in the UI\nand through the API, and is used when populating a catalog.\nThe example also shows how these values can be passed as environment variables to the launch command.\nThe $brooklyn:config(...) function returns the config value supplied or default.\nFor the type port, an attribute sensor is also created to report the actual port used after port inference,\nand so the $brooklyn:attributeWhenReady(...) function is used.\n(If $brooklyn:config(\"netcat.port\") had been used, 4321+ would be passed as NETCAT_PORT.)\nThis gives us quite a bit more power in writing our blueprint:\n\nMultiple instances of the server can be launched simultaneously on the same host, \nas the 4321+ syntax enables Brooklyn to assign them different ports\nIf this type is added to the catalog, a user can configure the message and the port;\nwe'll show this in the next section\n\nUsing the Catalog and Clustering\nThe Catalog tab allows you to add blueprints which you can refer to in other blueprints.\nIn that tab, click + then YAML, and enter the following:\nbrooklyn.catalog:\n  id: netcat-example\n  version: \"1.0\"\n  itemType: entity\n  item:\n    type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.VanillaSoftwareProcess\n    name: Simple Netcat Server\n\n    brooklyn.config:\n      launch.command: |\n        echo $MESSAGE | nc -l $NETCAT_PORT &\n        echo $! > $PID_FILE\n\n      shell.env:\n        MESSAGE: $brooklyn:config(\"message\")\n        NETCAT_PORT: $brooklyn:attributeWhenReady(\"netcat.port\")\n\n    brooklyn.parameters:\n    - name: message\n      description: a message to send to the caller\n      default: hello\n    - name: netcat.port\n      type: port\n      description: the port netcat should run on\n      default: 4321+\n\n    brooklyn.enrichers:\n    - type: org.apache.brooklyn.enricher.stock.Transformer\n      brooklyn.config:\n        uniqueTag: main-uri-generator\n        enricher.sourceSensor: $brooklyn:sensor(\"host.address\")\n        enricher.targetSensor: $brooklyn:sensor(\"main.uri\")\n        enricher.targetValue:\n          $brooklyn:formatString:\n          - \"http://%s:%s/\"\n          - $brooklyn:attributeWhenReady(\"host.address\")\n          - $brooklyn:attributeWhenReady(\"netcat.port\")\n\nThis is the same example as in the previous section, wrapped according to the catalog YAML requirements,\nwith one new block added defining an enricher. An enricher creates a new sensor from other values;\nin this case it will create a main.uri sensor by populating a printf-style string \"http://%s:%s\"\nwith the sensor values.\nWith this added to the catalog, we can reference the type netcat-example when we deploy an application.\nReturn to the Home or Applications tab, click +, and submit this YAML blueprint:\nname: Netcat Type Reference Example\nlocation: localhost\nservices:\n- type: netcat-example\n  message: hello from netcat using a registered type\n\nThis extends the previous blueprint which we registered in the catalog,\nmeaning that we don't need to include it each time.\nHere, we've elected to supply our own message, but we'll use the default port.\nMore importantly, we can package it for others to consume -- or take items others have built.\nWe can go further and use this to deploy a cluster,\nthis time giving a custom port as well as a custom message: \nname: Netcat Cluster Example\nlocation: localhost\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.group.DynamicCluster\n  brooklyn.config:\n    dynamiccluster.memberspec:\n      $brooklyn:entitySpec:\n        type: netcat-example\n        message: hello from cluster member\n        netcat.port: 8000+\n    cluster.initial.size: 3\n    dynamiccluster.restartMode: parallel\n\nIn either of the above examples, if you explore the tree in the Applications view\nand look at the Summary tab of any of the server instances, you'll now see the URL where netcat is running.\nBut remember, netcat will stop after one run, so you'll only be able to use each link once\nbefore you have to restart it.  You can also run restart on the cluster,\nand if you haven't yet experimented with resize on the cluster you might want to do that.\nAttaching Policies\nBesides detecting this failure, Brooklyn policies can be added to the YAML to take appropriate \naction. A simple recovery here might just to automatically restart the process:\nname: Netcat Example with Restarter Policy\nlocation: localhost\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.VanillaSoftwareProcess\n  id: netcat-server\n  name: Simple Netcat Server\n  brooklyn.config:\n    launch.command: |\n      echo hello | nc -l 4321 &\n      echo $! > $PID_FILE\n  brooklyn.enrichers:\n  - type: org.apache.brooklyn.policy.ha.ServiceFailureDetector\n    brooklyn.config:\n      # wait 15s after service fails before propagating failure\n      serviceFailedStabilizationDelay: 15s\n  brooklyn.policies:\n  - type: org.apache.brooklyn.policy.ha.ServiceRestarter\n    brooklyn.config:\n      # repeated failures in a time window can cause the restarter to abort,\n      # propagating the failure; a time window of 0 will mean it always restarts!\n      failOnRecurringFailuresInThisDuration: 0\n\nAutonomic management in Brooklyn often follows the principle that complex behaviours emerge\nfrom composing simple policies.\nThe blueprint above uses one policy to triggering a failure sensor when the service is down,\nand another responds to such failures by restarting the service.\nThis makes it easy to configure various aspects, such as to delay to see if the service itself recovers\n(which here we've set to 15 seconds) or to bail out on multiple failures within a time window (which again we are not doing).\nRunning with this blueprint, you'll see that the service shows as on fire for 15s after a telnet localhost 4321,\nbefore the policy restarts it. \nSensors and Effectors\nEffectors\nFor an even more interesting way to test it, look at the blueprint defining\na netcat server and client.\nThis uses brooklyn.initializers to define an effector to sayHiNetcat on the Simple Pinger client,\nusing env variables to inject the netcat-server location and \nparameters to pass in per-effector data:\n  env:\n    TARGET_HOSTNAME: $brooklyn:entity(\"netcat-server\").attributeWhenReady(\"host.name\")\n  brooklyn.initializers:\n  - type: org.apache.brooklyn.core.effector.ssh.SshCommandEffector\n    brooklyn.config:\n      name: sayHiNetcat\n      description: Echo a small hello string to the netcat entity\n      command: |\n        echo $message | nc $TARGET_HOSTNAME 4321\n      parameters:\n        message:\n          description: The string to pass to netcat\n          defaultValue: hi netcat\nSensors\nThis blueprint also uses initializers to define sensors on the netcat-server entity\nso that the $message we passed above gets logged and reported back:\n  launch.command: |\n    echo hello | nc -l 4321 >> server-input &\n    echo $! > $PID_FILE\n  brooklyn.initializers:\n  - type: org.apache.brooklyn.core.sensor.ssh.SshCommandSensor\n    brooklyn.config:\n      name: output.last\n      period: 1s\n      command: tail -1 server-input\nWindows Command Sensor\nLike the blueprint above, the following example also uses brooklyn.initializers to define sensors on the entity,\nthis time however it is a windows VM and uses WinRmCommandSensor.\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.VanillaWindowsProcess\n  brooklyn.config:\n    launch.command: echo launching\n    checkRunning.command: echo running\n  brooklyn.initializers:\n  - type: org.apache.brooklyn.core.sensor.windows.WinRmCommandSensor\n    brooklyn.config:\n      name: ip.config\n      period: 60s\n      command: hostname\nHealth Check Sensors\nAs mentioned previously, the default health check is to execute the check-running\ncommand over ssh every 5 seconds. This can be very CPU intensive when there are many entities. An alternative\nis to disable the ssh-polling (by setting sshMonitoring.enabled: false) and to configure a different \nhealth-check.\nSee documentation on the Entity's error status\nfor how Brooklyn models an entity's health.\nIn the snippet below, we'll define a new health-check sensor (via http polling), and will automatically add this\nto the service.notUp.indicators.

The policy monitors the sensor configured by start.sensor \nand will only execute the effector at the specified time if this is set to true.\nThere are two modes of operation, one based solely on policy configuration where the effector will execute at the time set \nusing the time key or after the duration set using the wait key, or by monitoring sensors. The policy monitors the \nscheduler.invoke.now sensor and will execute the effector immediately when its value changes to true. \nWhen the scheduler.invoke.at sensor changes, it will set a time in the future when the effector should be executed.\nThe following example calls a backup effector every night at midnight.\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.policy.action.ScheduledEffectorPolicy\n  brooklyn.config:\n    effector: backup\n    time: 00:00:00\nFollowTheSun Policy\n\norg.apache.brooklyn.policy.followthesun.FollowTheSunPolicy\n\nThe FollowTheSunPolicy is for moving work around to follow the demand.

It will monitor the addition of WinRmMachineLocation to an entity and then create a sensor advertising the administrative user's credentials.\nWriting a Policy\nYour First Policy\nPolicies perform the active management enabled by Brooklyn.\nEach policy instance is associated with an entity,\nand at runtime it will typically subscribe to sensors on that entity or children,\nperforming some computation and optionally actions when a subscribed sensor event occurs.\nThis action might be invoking an effector or emitting a new sensor,\ndepending the desired behavior is.\nWriting a policy is straightforward.\nSimply extend AbstractPolicy,\noverriding the setEntity method to supply any subscriptions desired:\n    @Override\n    public void setEntity(EntityLocal entity) {\n        super.setEntity(entity)\n        subscribe(entity, TARGET_SENSOR, this)\n    }\n\nand supply the computation and/or activity desired whenever that event occurs:\n    @Override\n    public void onEvent(SensorEvent event) {\n        int val = event.getValue()\n        if (val % 2 == 1)\n            entity.sayYoureOdd();\n    }\n\nYou'll want to do more complicated things, no doubt,\nlike access other entities, perform multiple subscriptions,\nand emit other sensors -- and you can.\nSee the best practices below and source code for some commonly used policies and enrichers,\nsuch as AutoScalerPolicy and RollingMeanEnricher.\nOne rule of thumb, to close on:\ntry to keep policies simple, and compose them together at runtime;\nfor instance, if a complex computation triggers an action,\ndefine one enricher policy to aggregate other sensors and emit a new sensor,\nthen write a second policy to perform that action.\nBest Practice\nThe following recommendations should be considered when designing policies:\nManagement should take place as \"low\" as possible in the hierarchy\n\nplace management responsibility in policies at the entity, as much as possible ideally management should take run as a policy on the relevant entity\n\nplace escalated management responsibility at the parent entity. Where this is impractical, perhaps because two aspects of an entity are best handled in two different places, ensure that the separation of responsibilities is documented and there is a group membership relationship between secondary/aspect managers.\n\n\nPolicies should be small and composable\ne.g. one policy which takes a sensor and emits a different, enriched sensor, and a second policy which responds to the enriched sensor of the first     (e.g. a policy detects a process is maxed out and emits a TOO_HOT sensor; a second policy responds to this by scaling up the VM where it is running, requesting more CPU)\nWhere a policy cannot resolve a situation at an entity, the issue should be escalated to a manager with a compatible policy.\nTypically escalation will go to the entity parent, and then cascade up.\ne.g. if the earlier VM CPU cannot be increased, the TOO_HOT event may go to the parent, a cluster entity, which attempts to balance. If the cluster cannot balance, then to another policy which attempts to scale out the cluster, and should the cluster be unable to scale, to a third policy which emits TOO_HOT for the cluster.\nManagement escalation should be carefully designed so that policies are not incompatible\nOrder policies carefully, and mark sensors as \"handled\" (or potentially \"swallow\" them locally), so that subsequent policies and parent entities do not take superfluous (or contradictory) corrective action.\nImplementation Classes\nExtend AbstractPolicy, or override an existing policy.\n"},"blueprints/effectors.html":{"url":"blueprints/effectors.html","title":"Effectors","keywords":"","body":"Effectors perform an operation of some kind, carried out by a Brooklyn Entity.\nThey can be manually invoked or triggered by a Policy.\nCommon uses of an effector include the following:\n\nPerform a command on a remote machine.\nCollect data and publish them to sensors.\n\nEntities have default effectors, the lifecycle management effectors like start, stop, restart, and clearly more Effectors can be attached to them.\nOff-the-Shelf Effectors\nEffectors are highly reusable as their inputs, thresholds and targets are customizable.\nSSHCommandEffector\nAn Effector to invoke a command on a node accessible via SSH.\nIt enables execution of a command in a specific execution director (executionDir) by using a custom shell environment (shellEnv).\nBy default, the specified command will be executed on the entity where the effector is attached or on all children or all members (if it is a group) by configuring executionTarget.\nThere are a number of additional configuration keys available for the SSHCommandEffector:\n\n\n\nConfiguration Key\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncommand\n\ncommand to be executed on the execution target\n\n\nexecutionDir\n\npossible values: 'GET', 'HEAD', 'POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS', 'TRACE'\n\n\nshellEnv\n\ncustom shell environment where the command is executed\n\n\nexecutionTarget\nENTITY\npossible values: 'MEMBERS', 'CHILDREN'\n\n\n\nHere is a simple example of an SshCommandEffector definition:\n  brooklyn.initializers:\n  -

For example, \nif creating a project named \"autobrick\" for \"com.acme\":\n$ BROOKLYN_VERSION={{ book.brooklyn-version }}\n$ mvn archetype:generate \\\n    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.brooklyn \\\n    -DarchetypeArtifactId=brooklyn-archetype-quickstart \\\n    -DarchetypeVersion=${BROOKLYN_VERSION} \\\n    -DgroupId=com.acme \\\n    -DartifactId=autobrick \\\n    -Dversion=0.1.0-SNAPSHOT \\\n    -DpackageName=com.acme.autobrick \\\n    -DinteractiveMode=false\n\nThis will create a directory with the artifact name (e.g. \"autobrick\" in the example above).\nNote that if run from a directory containing a pom, it will also modify that pom to add this as \na module!\nThe project will contain an example Java entity.

It can then be used in the same way as regular Brooklyn \nentities.\nFor example, you can use the blueprint:\nservices:\n- type: com.acme.autobrick.MySample\n\nTesting Entities\nThe project comes with unit tests that demonstrate how to test entities, both within Java and\nalso using YAML-based blueprints.\nA strongly recommended way is to write a YAML test blueprint using the test framework, and makingthis available to anyone who will use your entity.

These need to be made available to the\nApache Brooklyn runtime. There are a number of ways this can be achieved.\nClassic Mode: Dropins Folder\nIn Brooklyn classic mode (i.e. when not using Karaf), jars can be added to ./lib/dropins/.\nAfter restarting Brooklyn, these will be available on the classpath.\nIn Brooklyn classic mode, there is an embedded OSGi container. This is used for installing \nlibraries referenced in catalog items.\nOSGi Bundles\nIntroduction to OSGi Bundles\nAn OSGi bundle is a jar file with additional \nmetadata in its manifest file. The MANIFEST.MF file contains the symbolic name and version \nof the bundle, along with details of its dependencies and of the packages it exports \n(which are thus visible to other bundles).\nThe maven-bundle-plugin \nis a convenient way of building OSGi bundles.\nOSGi Bundles Declared in Catalog Items\nWithin a catalog item, a list of URLs can be supplied under\nbrooklyn.libraries. Each URL should point to an OSGi bundle. This list should include the OSGi \nbundle that has the Java code for your blueprint, and also the OSGi bundles that it depends\non (including all transitive dependencies).\nIt is vital that these jars are built correctly as OSGi bundles, and that all transitive \ndependencies are included. The bundles will be added to Karaf in the order given, so a bundle's\ndependencies should be listed before the bundle(s) that depend on them.\nIn the GistGenerator example, the \ncatalog.bom file included\nthe URL of the dependency org.eclipse.egit.github.core. It also (before that line) included\nits transitive dependency, which is a specific version of gson.\nFor Java blueprint developers, this is often the most convenient way to share a blueprint.\nSimilarly for those wishing to use a new blueprint, this is often the simplest mechanism: the\ndependencies are fully described in the catalog item, which makes it convenient for deploying \nto Apache Brooklyn instances where there is not direct access to Karaf or the file system.\nAdding Bundles and Features Directly to Karaf\nBundles and features can be added manually, directly to Karaf.\nHowever, note this only affects the single Karaf instance. If running in HA mode or if provisioning\na new instance of Apache Brooklyn, the bundles will also need to be added to these Karaf instances.\nKaraf Console\nLogin to the Karaf console\nusing ./bin/client, and add the bundles and features as desired.\nExamples of some useful commands are shown below:\nkaraf@amp> bundle:install -s http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/servicemix/bundles/org.apache.servicemix.bundles.egit.github.core/2.1.5_1/org.apache.servicemix.bundles.egit.github.core-2.1.5_1.jar\nBundle ID: 316\n\nkaraf@amp> bundle:list -t 0 -s | grep github\n318 | Active   |  80 | 2.1.5.1                       | org.apache.servicemix.bundles.egit.github.core\n\nkaraf@amp> bundle:headers org.apache.servicemix.bundles.egit.github.core\n...\n\nkaraf@amp> bundle:uninstall org.apache.servicemix.bundles.egit.github.core\n\nKaraf Deploy Folder\nKaraf support hot deployment. There are a \nset of deployers, such as feature and KAR deployers, that handle deployment of artifacts added\nto the deploy folder.\nNote that the Karaf console can give finer control (including for uninstall).\nKaraf KAR files\nKaraf KAR is an archive format (Karaf ARchive).\nA KAR is a jar file (so a zip file), which contains a set of feature descriptors and bundle jar files.\nThis can be a useful way to bundle a more complex Java blueprint (along with its dependencies), to\nmake it easier for others to install.\nA KAR file can be built using the \nmaven plugin org.apache.karaf.tooling:features-maven-plugin.\nKaraf Features\nA karaf feature.xml\ndefines a set of bundles that make up a feature. Once a feature is defined, one can add it to a Karaf instance:\neither directly (e.g. using the Karaf console), or\nby referencing it in another feature.xml file. \nEmbedded Dependencies\nAn OSGi bundle can \nembed jar dependencies\nwithin it. This allows dependencies to be kept private within a bundle, and easily shipped with that bundle.\nTo keep these private, it is vital that the OSGi bundle does not import or export the packages\ncontained within those embedded jars, and does not rely on any of those packages in the public \nsignatures of any packages that are exported or imported.\nConverting Non-OSGi Dependencies to Bundles\nIf a dependencies is not available as an OSGi bundle (and you don't want to just embed the jar),\nthere are a few options for getting an equivalent OSGi bundle:\n\nUse a ServiceMix re-packaged jar, if available. ServiceMix have re-packed many common dependencies as\nOSGi bundles, and published them on Maven Central.\n\nUse the wrap: prefix. The PAX URL Wrap protocol \nis an OSGi URL handler that can process your legacy jar at runtime and transform it into an OSGi bundle.This can be used when declaring a dependency in your feature.xml, and when using the Karaf console's \nbundle:install. Note that it is not yet supported in Brooklyn's brooklyn.libraries catalog items.\n\nRe-package the bundle yourself, offline, to produce a valid OSGi bundle.\n\n\n"},"blueprints/java/topology-dependencies.html":{"url":"blueprints/java/topology-dependencies.html","title":"Topology, Dependencies, and Management Policies","keywords":"","body":"Applications written in YAML can similarly be written in Java.

The init method is called only once, when\ninstantiating the entity instance.\nThe addChild method takes an EntitySpec. This describes the entity to be created, defining\nits type and its configuration.\nThe brooklyn.example.db.url is a system property that will be passed to each TomcatServer \ninstance. Its value is the database's URL (discussed below).\nThe policies and enrichers provide in-life management of the application, to restart failed\ninstances and to replace those components that repeatedly fail.\nThe NginxController is the load-balancer and reverse-proxy: by default, it round-robins to \nthe ip:port of each member of the cluster configured as the SERVER_POOL.\n\nDependent Configuration\nOften a component of an application will depend on another component, where the dependency\ninformation is only available at runtime (e.g. it requires the IP of a dynamically provisioned\ncomponent). For example, the app-servers in the example above require the database URL to be \ninjected.\nThe \"DependentConfiguration\" methods returns a future (or a \"promise\" in the language of \nsome other programming languages): when the  value is needed, the caller will block to wait forthe future to resolve. It will block only \"at the last moment\" when the value is needed (e.g. \nafter the VMs have been provisioned and the software is installed, thus optimising the \nprovisioning time). It will automatically monitor the given entity's sensor, and generate the \nvalue when the sensor is populated.\nThe attributeWhenReady is used to generate a configuration value that depends on the dynamic \nsensor value of another entity - in the example above, it will not be available until that \nMySqlNode.DATASTORE_URL sensor is populated. At that point, the JDBC URL will be constructed \n(as defined in the formatString method, which also returns a future).\n"},"blueprints/java/common-usage.html":{"url":"blueprints/java/common-usage.html","title":"Common Classes and Entities","keywords":"","body":"\nEntity Class Hierarchy\nBy convention in Brooklyn the following words have a particular meaning:\n\nGroup - a homogeneous grouping of entities (which need not all be managed by the same parent \nentity)\nCluster - a homogeneous collection of entities (all managed by the \"cluster\" entity)\nFabric - a multi-location collection of entities, with one per location; often used with a cluster per location\nApplication - a top-level entity, which can have one or more child entities.\n\nThe following constructs are often used for Java entities:\n\nentity spec defines an entity to be created; used to define a child entity, or often to \ndefine the type of entity in a cluster.\ntraits (mixins) providing certain capabilities, such as Resizable and Startable.\nResizable entities can re-sized dynamically, to increase/decrease the number of child entities.\nFor example, scaling up or down a cluster. It could similarly be used to vertically scale a VM,\nor to resize a disk.\nStartable indicates the effector to be executed on initial deployment (start()) and on \ntear down (stop()).\n\nConfiguration\nConfiguration keys are typically defined as static named fields on the Entity interface. These\ndefine the configuration values that can be passed to the entity during construction. For\nexample:\npublic static final ConfigKey ROOT_WAR = new ConfigKeys.newStringConfigKey(\n        \"wars.root\",\n        \"WAR file to deploy as the ROOT, as URL (supporting file: and classpath: prefixes)\");\n\nIf supplying a default value, it is important that this be immutable. Otherwise, it risks users\nof the blueprint modifying the default value, which would affect blueprints that are subsequently \ndeployed.\nOne can optionally define a @SetFromFlag(\"war\"). This defines a short-hand for configuring the\nentity. However, it should be used with caution - when using configuration set on a parent entity\n(and thus inherited), the @SetFromFlag short-form names are not checked. The long form defined \nin the constructor should be meaningful and sufficient. The usage of @SetFromFlag is therefore\ndiscouraged.\nThe type AttributeSensorAndConfigKey can be used to indicate that a config key should be resolved,\nand its value set as a sensor on the entity (when ConfigToAttributes.apply(entity) is called).\nA special case of this is PortAttributeSensorAndConfigKey. This is resolved to find an available \nport (by querying the target location). For example, the value 8081+ means that then next available\nport starting from 8081 will be used.\nDeclaring Sensors\nSensors are typically defined as static named fields on the Entity interface. These define \nthe events published by the entity, which interested parties can subscribe to. For example:\nAttributeSensor MANAGEMENT_URL = Sensors.newStringSensor(\n        \"crate.managementUri\",\n        \"The address at which the Crate server listens\");\n\nDeclaring Effectors\nEffectors are the operations that an entity supports. There are multiple ways that an entity can \nbe defined. Examples of each are given below.\nEffector Annotation\nA method on the entity interface can be annotated to indicate it is an effector, and to provide\nmetadata about the effector and its parameters.\n@org.apache.brooklyn.core.annotation.Effector(description=\"Retrieve a Gist\")\npublic String getGist(@EffectorParam(name=\"id\", description=\"Gist id\") String id);\n\nStatic Field Effector Declaration\nA static field can be defined on the entity to define an effector, giving metadata about that effector.\npublic static final Effector EXECUTE_SCRIPT = Effectors.effector(String.class, \"executeScript\")\n        .description(\"invokes a script\")\n        .parameter(ExecuteScriptEffectorBody.SCRIPT)\n        .impl(new ExecuteScriptEffectorBody())\n        .build();\n\nIn this example, the implementation of the effector is an instance of ExecuteScriptEffectorBody. \nThis implements EffectorBody. It will be invoked whenever the effector is called.\nDynamically Added Effectors\nAn effector can be added to an entity dynamically - either as part of the entity's init()\nor as separate initialization code. This allows the implementation of the effector to be shared\namongst multiple entities, without sub-classing. For example:\nEffector GET_GIST = Effectors.effector(Void.class, \"createGist\")\n        .description(\"Create a Gist\")\n        .parameter(String.class, \"id\", \"Gist id\")\n        .buildAbstract();\n\npublic static void CreateGistEffectorBody implements EffectorBody() {\n    @Override\n    public Void call(ConfigBag parameters) {\n        // impl\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void init() {\n    getMutableEntityType().addEffector(CREATE_GIST, new CreateGistEffectorBody());\n}\n\nEffector Invocation\nThere are several ways to invoke an effector programmatically:\n\nWhere there is an annotated method, simply call the method on the interface.\n\nCall the invoke method on the entity, using the static effector declaration. For example:entity.invoke(CREATE_GIST, ImmutableMap.of(\"id\", id));.\n\nCall the utility method org.apache.brooklyn.core.entity.Entities.invokeEffector. For example:Entities.invokeEffector(this, targetEntity, CREATE_GIST, ImmutableMap.of(\"id\", id));.\n\n\nWhen an effector is invoked, the call is intercepted to wrap it in a task. In this way, the \neffector invocation is tracked - it is shown in the Activity view.\nWhen invoke or invokeEffector is used, the call returns a Task object (which extends \nFuture). This allows the caller to understand progress and errors on the task, as well as \ncalling task.get() to retrieve the return value. Be aware that task.get() is a blocking \nfunction that will wait until a value is available before returning.\nTasks\nWarning: the task API may be changed in a future release. However, backwards compatibility\nwill be maintained where possible.\nWhen implementing entities and policies, all work done within Brooklyn is executed as Tasks.\nThis makes it trackable and visible to administrators. For the activity list to show a break-down \nof an effector's work (in real-time, and also after completion), tasks and sub-tasks must be \ncreated.\nIn common situations, tasks are implicitly created and executed. For example, when implementing\nan effector using the @Effector annotation on a method, the method invocation is automatically\nwrapped as a task. Similarly, when a subscription is passed an event (e.g. when using \nSensorEventListener.onEvent(SensorEvent event), that call is done inside a task.\nWithin a task, it is possible to create and execute sub-tasks. A common way to do this is to \nuse DynamicTasks.queue. If called from within a a \"task queuing context\" (e.g. from inside an\neffector implementation), it will add the task to be executed. By default, the outer task will not be\nmarked as done until its queued sub-tasks are complete.\nWhen creating tasks, the TaskBuilder can be used to create simple tasks or to create compound tasks\nwhose sub-tasks are to be executed either sequentially or in parallel. For example:\nTaskBuilder.builder()\n        .displayName(\"stdout-example\")\n        .body(new Callable() { public Integer call() { System.out.println(\"example\"; } })\n        .build();\n\nThere are also builder and factory utilities for common types of operation, such as executing SSH \ncommands using SshTasks.\nA lower level way to submit tasks within an entity is to call getExecutionContext().submit(...).\nThis automatically tags the task to indicate that its context is the given entity.\nAn even lower level way to execute tasks (to be ignored except for power-users) is to go straightto the getManagementContext().getExecutionManager().submit(...). This is similar to the standard\nJava Executor, but also supports more metadata about tasks such as descriptions and tags.\nIt also supports querying for tasks. There is also support for submitting ScheduledTask \ninstances which run periodically.\nThe Tasks and BrooklynTaskTags classes supply a number of conveniences including builders to \nmake working with tasks easier.\nSubscriptions and the Subscription Manager\nEntities, locations, policies and enrichers can subscribe to events. These events could be\nattribute-change events from other entities, or other events explicitly published by the entities.\nA subscription is created by calling subscriptions().subscribe(entity, sensorType, sensorEventListener).\nThe sensorEventListener will be called with the event whenever the given entity emits a sensor of\nthe given type. If null is used for either the entity or sensor type, this is treated as a \nwildcard.\nIt is very common for a policy or enricher to subscribe to events, to kick off actions or to \npublish other aggregated attributes or events. \n"},"blueprints/java/feeds.html":{"url":"blueprints/java/feeds.html","title":"Feeds","keywords":"","body":"\nFeeds\nFeeds within Apache Brooklyn are used to populate an entity's sensors. There are a variety of \nfeed types, which commonly poll to retrieve the raw metrics of the entity (for example polling an \nHTTP management API, or over JMX).  \nPersistence\nThere are two ways to associate a feed with an entity.\nThe first way is (within the entity) to call feeds().addFeed(...).\nThis persists the feed: the feed will be automatically\nadded to the entity when the Brooklyn server restarts. It is important that all configuration\nof the feed is persistable (e.g. not using any in-line anonymous inner classes to define\nfunctions).\nThe feed builders can be passed a uniqueTag(...), which will be used to ensure that on\nrebind there will not be multiple copied of the feed (e.g. if rebind() had already re-created\nthe feed).\nThe second way is to just pass to the feed's builder the entity. When using this mechanism, \nthe feed will be wired up to the entity but it will not be persisted. In this case, it is\nimportant that the entity's rebind() method recreates the feed.\nTypes of Feed\nHTTP Feed\nAn HttpFeed polls over http(s).

The values are extracted from the response, and published to the\nentity's sensors. An example is shown below:\nprivate WindowsPerformanceCounterFeed feed;\n\n@Override\nprotected void connectSensors() {\n  feed = feeds.addFeed(WindowsPerformanceCounterFeed.builder()\n      .addSensor(\"\\\\Processor(_total)\\\\% Idle Time\", CPU_IDLE_TIME)\n      .addSensor(\"\\\\Memory\\\\Available MBytes\", AVAILABLE_MEMORY)\n      .build());\n}\n\n@Override\nprotected void disconnectSensors() {\n  super.disconnectSensors();\n  if (feed != null) feed.stop();\n}\n\nJMX Feed\nThis type of feed queries over JMX to retrieve sensor values. This can query attribute\nvalues or call operations.\nThe JMX connection details can be automatically inferred from the entity's standard attributes,\nor it can be explicitly supplied.\nAn example is shown below:\nprivate JmxFeed feed;\n\n@Override\nprotected void connectSensors() {\n  super.connectSensors();\n\n  feed = feeds().addFeed(JmxFeed.builder()\n      .period(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)\n      .pollAttribute(new JmxAttributePollConfig(ERROR_COUNT)\n          .objectName(requestProcessorMbeanName)\n          .attributeName(\"errorCount\"))\n      .pollAttribute(new JmxAttributePollConfig(SERVICE_UP)\n          .objectName(serverMbeanName)\n          .attributeName(\"Started\")\n          .onError(Functions.constant(false)))\n      .build());\n}\n\nOverride\nprotected void disconnectSensors() {\n  super.disconnectSensors();\n  if (feed != null) feed.stop();\n}\n\nFunction Feed\nThis type of feed periodically executes something to compute the attribute values. This \ncan be a Callable, Supplier or Groovy Closure. It must be persistable (e.g. not use \nan in-line anonymous inner classes).\nAn example is shown below:\npublic static class ErrorCountRetriever implements Callable {\n  private final Entity entity;\n\n  public ErrorCountRetriever(Entity entity) {\n    this.entity = entity;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Integer call() throws Exception {\n    // TODO your implementation...\n    return 0;\n  }\n}\n\nprivate FunctionFeed feed;\n\n@Override\nprotected void connectSensors() {\n  super.connectSensors();\n\n  feed = feeds().addFeed(FunctionFeed.builder()\n    .poll(new FunctionPollConfig(ERROR_COUNT)\n        .period(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)\n        .callable(new ErrorCountRetriever(this))\n        .onExceptionOrFailure(Functions.constant(null))\n    .build());\n}\n\n@Override\nprotected void disconnectSensors() {\n  super.disconnectSensors();\n  if (feed != null) feed.stop();\n}\n\n"},"blueprints/java/entity.html":{"url":"blueprints/java/entity.html","title":"Writing an Entity","keywords":"","body":"Ways to write an entity\nThere are several ways to write a new entity:\n\nFor Unix/Linux, write YAML blueprints, for example using a VanillaSoftwareProcess and \nconfiguring it with your scripts.\nFor Windows, write YAML blueprints using VanillaWindowsProcess and configure the PowerShell\nscripts.\nFor composite entities, use YAML to compose exiting types of entities (potentially overwriting\nparts of their configuration), and wire them together.\nUse Chef recipes.\nUse Salt formulas.\nUse Ansible playbooks.\nWrite pure-java, extending existing base-classes. For example, the GistGenerator \nexample. These can use utilities such as HttpTool and \nBashCommands.\nWrite pure-Java blueprints that extend SoftwareProcess. However, the YAML approach is strongly\nrecommended over this approach.\nWrite pure-Java blueprints that compose together existing entities, for example to manage\na cluster. Often this is possible in YAML and that approach is strongly recommended. However,\nsometimes the management logic may be so complex that it is easier to use Java.\n\nThe rest of this section covers writing an entity in pure-java (or other JVM languages).\nThings To Know\nAll entities have an interface and an implementation. The methods on the interface \nare its effectors; the interface also defines its sensors.\nEntities are created through the management context (rather than calling theconstructor directly). This returns a proxy for the entity rather than the real \ninstance, which is important in a distributed management plane.\nAll entity implementations inherit from AbstractEntity, often through one of the following:\n\nSoftwareProcessImpl:  if it's a software process\nVanillaJavaAppImpl:  if it's a plain-old-java app\nJavaWebAppSoftwareProcessImpl:  if it's a JVM-based web-app\nDynamicClusterImpl, DynamicGroupImpl or AbstractGroupImpl:  if it's a collection of other entities\n\nSoftware-based processes tend to use drivers to install and\nlaunch the remote processes onto locations which support that driver type.\nFor example, AbstractSoftwareProcessSshDriver is a common driver superclass,\ntargetting SshMachineLocation (a machine to which Brooklyn can ssh).\nThe various SoftwareProcess entities above (and some of the exemplars \nlisted at the end of this page) have their own dedicated drivers.\nFinally, there are a collection of traits, such as Resizable, \nin the package brooklyn.entity.trait. These provide common\nsensors and effectors on entities, supplied as interfaces.\nChoose one (or more) as appropriate.\nKey Steps\nNOTE: Consider instead writing a YAML blueprint for your entity.\nSo to get started:\n\nCreate your entity interface, extending the appropriate selection from above,\nto define the effectors and sensors.\nInclude an annotation like @ImplementedBy(YourEntityImpl.class) on your interface,\nwhere YourEntityImpl will be the class name for your entity implementation.\nCreate your entity class, implementing your entity interface and extending the \nclasses for your chosen entity super-types. Naming convention is a suffix \"Impl\"\nfor the entity class, but this is not essential.\nCreate a driver interface, again extending as appropriate (e.g. SoftwareProcessDriver).\nThe naming convention is to have a suffix \"Driver\". \nCreate the driver class, implementing your driver interface, and again extending as appropriate.\nNaming convention is to have a suffix \"SshDriver\" for an ssh-based implementation.\nThe correct driver implementation is found using this naming convention, or via custom\nnamings provided by the BasicEntityDriverFactory.\nWire the public Class getDriverInterface() method in the entity implementation, to specify\nyour driver interface.\nProvide the implementation of missing lifecycle methods in your driver class (details below)\nConnect the sensors from your entity (e.g. overriding connectSensors() of SoftwareProcessImpl)..\nSee the sensor feeds, such as HttpFeed and JmxFeed.\n\nAny JVM language can be used to write an entity. However use of pure Java is encouraged for\nentities in core brooklyn. \nHelpful References\nA few handy pointers will help make it easy to build your own entities.\nCheck out some of the exemplar existing entities\n(note, some of the other entities use deprecated utilities and a deprecated class \nhierarchy; it is suggested to avoid these, looking at the ones below instead):\n\nJBoss7Server\nMySqlNode\n\nYou might also find the following helpful:\n\nEntity Design Tips\nThe User Guide\nThe Mailing List\n\n"},"blueprints/java/entities.html":{"url":"blueprints/java/entities.html","title":"Custom Entity Development","keywords":"","body":"This section details how to create new custom application components or groups as brooklyn entities.\nThe Entity Lifecycle\n\nImportance of serialization, ref to How mananagement works\nParents and Membership (groups)\n\nWhat to Extend -- Implementation Classes\n\nentity implementation class hierarchy\n\nSoftwareProcess as the main starting point for base entities (corresponding to software processes),\nand subclasses such as VanillaJavaApp\nDynamicCluster (multiple instances of the same entity in a location) and \nDynamicFabric (clusters in multiple location) for automatically creating many instances,\nsupplied with an EntityFactory (e.g. BaseEntityFactory) in the factory flag\nAbstractGroup for collecting entities which are parented elsewhere in the hierachy\nAbstractEntity if nothing else fits\n\n\ntraits (mixins, otherwise known as interfaces with statics) to define available config keys, sensors, and effectors;\n  and conveniences e.g. StartableMethods.{start,stop} is useful for entities which implement Startable\n\nthe Entities class provides some generic convenience methods; worth looking at it for any work you do\n\n\nA common lifecycle pattern is that the start effector (see more on effectors below) is invoked, \noften delegating either to a driver (for software processes) or children entities (for clusters etc).\nConfiguration\n\n\nAttributeSensorAndConfigKey fields can be automatically converted for SoftwareProcess. \nThis is done in preStart(). This must be done manually if required for other entities,\noften with ConfigToAttributes.apply(this).\n\nSetting ports is a special challenge, and one which the AttributeSensorAndConfigKey is particularly helpful for,\ncf PortAttributeSensorAndConfigKey (a subclass),\ncausing ports automatically get assigned from a range and compared with the target PortSupplied location.\nSyntax is as described in the PortRange interface. For example, \"8080-8099,8800+\" will try port 8080, try sequentially through 8099, then try from 8800 until all ports are exhausted.\nThis is particularly useful on a contended machine (localhost!). Like ordinary configuration, the config is done by the user, and the actual port used is reported back as a sensor on the entity.\n\nValidation of config values can be applied by supplying a Predicate to the constraint of a ConfigKey builder.\nConstraints are tested after an entity is initialised and before an entity managed.\nUseful predicates include:\n\nStringPredicates.isNonBlank: require that a String key is neither null nor empty.\nResourcePredicates.urlExists: require that a URL that is loadable by Brooklyn. Use this to\nconfirm that necessary resources are available to the entity.\nPredicates.in: require one of a fixed set of values.\nPredicates.containsPattern: require that a value match a regular expression pattern.\n\nAn important caveat is that only constraints on config keys that are on an entity's type hierarchy can be\ntested automatically. Brooklyn has no knowledge of the true type of other keys until they are retrieved with a\nconfig().get(key).\n\n\nImplementing Sensors\n\ne.g. HTTP, JMX\n\nSensors at base entities are often retrieved by feeds which poll the entity's corresponding instance in the real world.\nThe SoftwareProcess provides a good example; by subclassing it and overriding the connectSensors() method\nyou could wire some example sensors using the following: \npublic void connectSensors() {\n    super.connectSensors()\n\n    httpFeed = HttpFeed.builder()\n            .entity(this)\n            .period(200)\n            .baseUri(mgmtUrl)\n            .poll(new HttpPollConfig(SERVICE_UP)\n                    .onSuccess(HttpValueFunctions.responseCodeEquals(200))\n                    .onError(Functions.constant(false)))\n            .poll(new HttpPollConfig(REQUEST_COUNT)\n                    .onSuccess(HttpValueFunctions.jsonContents(\"requestCount\", Integer.class)))\n            .build();\n}\n\n@Override\nprotected void disconnectSensors() {\n    super.disconnectSensors();\n    if (httpFeed != null) httpFeed.stop();\n}\n\nIn this example (a simplified version of JBoss7Server), the url returns metrics in JSON. \nWe report the entity as up if we get back an http response code of 200, or down if any other response code or exception.\nWe retrieve the request count from the response body, and convert it to an integer.\nNote the first line (super.connectSensors()); as one descends into specific convenience subclasses (such as for Java web-apps), the work done by the parent class's overridden methods may be relevant, and will want to be invoked or even added to a resulting list.\nFor some sensors, and often at compound entities, the values are obtained by monitoring values of other sensors on the same (in the case of a rolling average) or different (in the case of the average of children nodes) entities. This is achieved by policies, described below.\nImplementing Effectors\nThe Entity interface defines the sensors and effectors available. The entity class provides \nwiring for the sensors, and the effector implementations. In simple cases it may be straightforward \nto capture the behaviour of the effectors in a simple methods.\nFor example deploying a WAR to a cluster can be done as follows:\nThis section is not complete. Feel free to fork the docs and lend a hand.\n\nFor some entities, specifically base entities, the implementation of effectors might need other tools (such as SSH), and may vary by location, so having a single implementation is not appropriate.\nThe problem of multiple inheritance (e.g. SSH functionality and entity inheritance) and multiple implementations (e.g. SSH versus Windows) is handled in brooklyn using delegates called drivers. \nIn the implementations of JavaWebApp entities, the behaviour which the entity always does is captured in the entity class (for example, breaking deployment of multiple WARs into atomic actions), whereas implementations which is specific to a particular entity and driver (e.g. using scp to copy the WARs to the right place and install them, which of course is different among appservers, or using an HTTP or JMX management API, again where details vary between appservers) is captured in a driver class.\nRoutines which are convenient for specific drivers can then be inherited in the driver class hierarchy. For example, when passing JMX environment variables to Java over SSH, JavaSoftwareProcessSshDriver extends AbstractSoftwareProcessSshDriver and parents JBoss7SshDriver.\n\nTesting\n\nUnit tests can make use of SimulatedLocation and TestEntity, and can extend BrooklynAppUnitTestSupport.\nIntegration tests and use a LocalhostMachineProvisioningLocation, and can also extend BrooklynAppUnitTestSupport.\n\n\nSoftwareProcess Lifecycle\nSoftwareProcess is the common super-type of most integration components (when implementing in Java).\nSee JBoss7Server and MySqlNode for exemplars.\nThe methods called in a SoftwareProcess entity's lifecycle are described below. The most important steps are shown in bold (when writing a new entity, these are the methods most often implemented).\n\nInitial creation (via EntitySpec or YAML):\n\nno-arg constructor\ninit\nadd locations\napply initializers\nadd enrichers\nadd policies\nadd children\nmanages entity (so is discoverable by other entities)\n\n\nStart:\n\nprovisions new machine, if the location is a MachineProvisioningLocation\ncreates new driver\ncalls getDriverInterface\nInfers the concrete driver class from the machine-type, \ne.g. by default it adds \"Ssh\" before the word \"Driver\" in \"JBoss7Driver\".\ninstantiates the driver, calling the constructor to pass in the entity itself and the machine location\n\n\nsets attributes from config (e.g. for ports being used)\ncalls entity.preStart()\ncalls driver.start(), which:\nruns pre-install command (see config key pre.install.command)\nuploads install resources (see config keys files.install and templates.install)\ncalls driver.install()\nruns post-install command (see config key post.install.command)\ncalls driver.customize()\nuploads runtime resources (see config keys files.runtime and templates.runtime)\nruns pre-launch command (see config key pre.launch.command)\ncalls driver.launch()\nruns post-launch command (see config key post.launch.command)\ncalls driver.postLaunch()\n\n\ncalls entity.postDriverStart(), which:\ncalls enity.waitForEntityStart() - waits for driver.isRunning() to report true\n\n\ncalls entity.connectSensors()\ncalls entity.waitForServicUp()\ncalls entity.postStart()\n\n\nRestart:\n\nIf restarting machine...\ncalls entity.stop(), with stopMachine set to true.\ncalls start\nrestarts children (if configured to do so)\n\n\nElse (i.e. not restarting machine)...\ncalls entity.preRestart()\ncalls driver.restart()\ncalls driver.stop()\ncalls driver.launch()\ncalls driver.postLaunch()\n\n\nrestarts children (if configured to do so)\ncalls entity.postDriverStart(), which:\ncalls enity.waitForEntityStart() - polls driver.isRunning(), waiting for true\n\n\ncalls entity.waitForServicUp()\ncalls entity.postStart()\n\n\n\n\nStop:\n\ncalls entity.preStopConfirmCustom() - aborts if exception.\ncalls entity.preStop()\nstops the process:\nstops children (if configured to do so)\ncalls driver.stop()\n\n\nstops the machine (if configured to do so)\ncalls entity.postStop()\n\n\nRebind (i.e. when Brooklyn is restarted):\n\nno-arg constructor\nreconstitutes entity (e.g. setting config and attributes)\nIf entity was running...\ncalls entity.rebind(); if previously started then:\ncreates the driver (same steps as for start)\ncalls driver.rebind()\ncalls entity.connectSensors()\n\n\n\n\nattaches policies, enrichers and persisted feeds\nmanages the entity (so is discoverable by other entities)\n\n\n\n"},"blueprints/java/service-state.html":{"url":"blueprints/java/service-state.html","title":"Service State","keywords":"","body":"Any entity can use the standard \"service-up\" and \"service-state\" \nsensors to inform other entities and the GUI about its status.\nIn normal operation, entities should publish at least one \"service not-up indicator\",\nusing the ServiceNotUpLogic.updateNotUpIndicator method.

These are vital for the generic effectors such as stopping and restarting the \nprocess.\nPowershell\nPowershell commands can be supplied using config options such as launch.powershell.command.\nThis is an alternative to supplying a standard batch command using config such as launch.command.\nFor a given phase, only one of the commands (Powershell or Batch) should be supplied.\nGetting the Right Exit Codes\nWinRM (or at least the chosen WinRM client!) can return a zero exit code even on error in certain \ncircumstances. It is therefore advisable to follow the guidelines below.\nFor a given command, write the Powershell or Batch script as a separate multi-command file. \nUpload this (e.g. by including it in the files.preinstall configuration). For the configuration\nof the given command, execute the file.\nWhen you have a command inside the powershell script which want to report its non zero exiting, \nplease consider adding a check for its exit code after it.\nExample:\n& \"C:\\install.exe\"\nIf ($lastexitcode -ne 0) {\n    exit $lastexitcode\n}\nFor Powershell files, consider including \n$ErrorActionPreference = \"Stop\"\nat the start of the file. \n$ErrorActionPreference Determines how Windows PowerShell responds to a non-terminating\nerror (an error that does not stop the cmdlet processing) at the\ncommand line or in a script, cmdlet, or provider, such as the\nerrors generated by the Write-Error cmdlet.\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847796.aspx\nSee Incorrect Exit Codes under Known Limitations below.\nExecuting Scripts From Batch Commands\nIn a batch command, you can execute a batch file or Powershell file. For example:\ninstall.command: powershell -NonInteractive -NoProfile -Command \"C:\\\\install7zip.ps1\"\nOr alternatively:\ninstall.command: C:\\\\install7zip.bat\nExecuting Scripts From Powershell\nIn a Powershell command, you can execute a batch file or Powershell file. There are many ways\nto do this (see official Powershell docs). For example:\ninstall.powershell.command: \"& C:\\\\install7zip.ps1\"\nOr alternatively:\ninstall.powershell.command: \"& C:\\\\install7zip.bat\"\nNote the quotes around the command. This is because the \"&\" has special meaning in a YAML value. \nParameterised Scripts\nCalling parameterised Batch and Powershell scripts is done in the normal Windows way - see\noffical Microsoft docs. For example:\ninstall.command: \"c:\\\\myscript.bat myarg1 myarg2\"\nOr as a Powershell example:\ninstall.powershell.command: \"& c:\\\\myscript.ps1 -key1 myarg1 -key2 myarg2\"\nIt is also possible to construct the script parameters by referencing attributes of this or\nother entities using the standard attributeWhenReady mechanism. For example:\ninstall.command: $brooklyn:formatString(\"c:\\\\myscript.bat %s\", component(\"db\").attributeWhenReady(\"datastore.url\"))\nPowershell - Using Start-Process\nWhen you are invoking a command from a powershell script with Start-Process cmdlet,\nplease use the -Wait and the -PassThru arguments.\nExample Start-Process C:\\mycommand -Wait -PassThru\nUsing -Wait guarantees that the script process and its children and thus the winrm session won't be terminated until it is finished.\n-PassThru Returns a process object for each process that the cmdlet started. By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.\nSee https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849848.aspx\nRebooting\nWhere a reboot is required as part of the entity setup, this can be configured using\nconfig like pre.install.reboot.required and install.reboot.required. If required, the \ninstallation commands can be split between the pre-install, install and post-install phases\nin order to do a reboot at the appropriate point of the VM setup.\nWe Strongly recommend to write blueprints in a way that they do NOT restart automatically windows and\nuse one of the pre.install.reboot.required or install.reboot.required parameters to perform restart.\nInstall Location\nBlueprint authors are encouraged to explicitly specify the full path for file uploads, and \nfor paths in their Powershell scripts (e.g. for installation, configuration files, log files, etc).\nHow and Why to re-authenticate within a powershell script\nSome installation scripts require the use of security-related operations. In some environments,these fail by default when executed over WinRM, even though the script may succeed when run locally(e.g. by using RDP to connect to the machine and running the script manually). There may be noclear indication from Windows why it failed (e.g. for MSSQL install, the only clue is asecurity exception in the installation log).\nWhen a script is run over WinRM, the credentials under which the script are run are marked as\n'remote' credentials, which are prohibited from running certain security-related operations. The \nsolution is to obtain a new set of credentials within the script and use those credentials to \nrequired commands.\nThe WinRM client uses Negotiate+NTLM to authenticate against the machine.\nThis mechanism applies certain restrictions to executing commands on the windows host.\nFor this reason you should enable CredSSP on the windows host which grants all privileges available to the user.\n https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849719.aspx#sectionSection4\nTo use Invoke-Command -Authentication CredSSP the Windows Machine has to have:\n\nUp and running WinRM over http. The custom-enable-credssp.ps1 script enables winrm over http because Invoke-Command use winrm over http by default.\nInvoke-Command can be used with -UseSSL option but this will lead to modifying powershell scripts.\nWith always enabling winrm over http on the host, blueprint's powershell scripts remain consistent and not depend on the winrm https/http environments.\nWe hope future versions of winrm4j will support CredSSP out of the box and wrapping commands in Invoke-Command will not be needed.\nAdded trusted host entries which will use Invoke-Command\nAllowed CredSSP\n\nAll the above requirements are enabled in Apache Brooklyn through brooklyn-server/software/base/src/main/resources/org/apache/brooklyn/software/base/custom-enable-credssp.ps1\nscript which enables executing commands with CredSSP in the general case.\nThe script works for most of the Windows images out there version 2008 and later.\nPlease ensure that Brooklyn's changes are compatible with your organisation's security policy.\nCheck Microsoft Documentation for more information about Negotiate authenticate mechanism on technet.microsoft.com.aspx)\nRe-authentication also requires that the password credentials are passed in plain text within the\nscript. Please be aware that it is normal for script files - and therefore the plaintext password - \nto be saved to the VM's disk. The scripts are also accessible via the Brooklyn web-console's \nactivity view. Access to the latter can be controlled via \nEntitlements.\nAs an example (taken from MSSQL install), the command below works when run locally, but fails over \nWinRM:\n( $driveLetter + \"setup.exe\") /ConfigurationFile=C:\\ConfigurationFile.ini\nThe code below can be used instead (note this example uses Freemarker templating):\n& winrm set winrm/config/service/auth '@{CredSSP=\"true\"}'\n& winrm set winrm/config/client/auth '@{CredSSP=\"true\"}'\n#\n$pass = '${attribute['windows.password']}'\n$secpasswd = ConvertTo-SecureString $pass -AsPlainText -Force\n$mycreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($($env:COMPUTERNAME + \"\\${location.user}\"), $secpasswd)\n#\n$exitCode = Invoke-Command -ComputerName $env:COMPUTERNAME -Credential $mycreds -ScriptBlock {\n    param($driveLetter)\n    $process = Start-Process ( $driveLetter + \"setup.exe\") -ArgumentList \"/ConfigurationFile=C:\\ConfigurationFile.ini\" -RedirectStandardOutput \"C:\\sqlout.txt\" -RedirectStandardError \"C:\\sqlerr.txt\" -Wait -PassThru -NoNewWindow\n    $process.ExitCode\n} -Authentication CredSSP -ArgumentList $driveLetter\n#\nexit $exitCode\nIn this example, the ${...} format is FreeMarker templating. Those sections will be substituted\nbefore the script is uploaded for execution. To explain this example in more detail:\n\n${attribute['windows.password']} is substituted for the entity's attribute \"windows.password\".\nThis (clear-text) password is sent as part of the script. Assuming that HTTPS and NTLM is used,\nthe script will be encrypted while in-flight.\n\nThe ${location.user} gets (from the entity's machine location) the username, substituting this \ntext for the actual username. In many cases, this will be \"Administrator\". However, on someclouds a different username (with admin privileges) will be used.\n\nThe username and password are used to create a new credential object (having first converted the\npassword to a secure string).\n\nCredential Security Service Provider (CredSSP) is used for authentication, to pass the explicitcredentials when using Invoke-Command.\n\n\nWindows AMIs on AWS\nWindows AMIs in AWS change regularly (to include the latest Windows updates). If using the community\nAMI, it is recommended to use an AMI name regex, rather than an image id, so that the latest AMI is \nalways picked up. If an image id is used, it may fail as Amazon will delete their old Windows AMIs.\nIf using an image regex, it is recommended to include the image owner in case someone else uploads\na similarly named AMI. For example:\nbrooklyn.location.named.AWS\\ Oregon\\ Win = jclouds:aws-ec2:us-west-2\nbrooklyn.location.named.AWS\\ Oregon\\ Win.imageNameRegex = Windows_Server-2012-R2_RTM-English-64Bit-Base-.*\nbrooklyn.location.named.AWS\\ Oregon\\ Win.imageOwner = 801119661308\n...\nstdout and stderr in a Powershell script\nWhen calling an executable in a Powershell script, the stdout and stderr will usually be output to the console.\nThis is captured by Brooklyn, and shown in the activities view under the specific tasks.\nAn alternative is to redirect stdout and stderr to a file on the VM, which can be helpful if one expects sys admins\nto log into the VM. However, be warned that this would hide the stdout/stderr from Brooklyn's activities view.\nFor example, instead of running the following:\nD:\\setup.exe /ConfigurationFile=C:\\ConfigurationFile.ini\n The redirect can be achieved by using the Start-Process scriptlet:\nStart-Process D:\\setup.exe -ArgumentList \"/ConfigurationFile=C:\\ConfigurationFile.ini\" -RedirectStandardOutput \"C:\\sqlout.txt\" -RedirectStandardError \"C:\\sqlerr.txt\" -PassThru -Wait\nThe -ArgumentList is simply the arguments that are to be passed to the executable, -RedirectStandardOutput and\nRedirectStandardError take file locations for the output (if the file already exists, it will be overwritten). The\n-PassThru argument indicates that Powershell should write to the file in addition to the console, rather than\ninstead of the console. The -Wait argument will cause the scriptlet to block until the process is complete.\nFurther details can be found on the Start-Process documentation page\non the Microsoft TechNet site.\nTroubleshooting\nMuch of the operations troubleshooting guide is applicable for Windows blueprints.  \nUser metadata service requirement\nWinRM requires activation and configuration before it will work in a standard Windows Server deployment. To automate\nthis, Brooklyn will place a setup script in the user metadata blob. Services such as Amazon EC2's Ec2ConfigService\nwill automatically load and execute this script. If your chosen cloud provider does not support Ec2ConfigService or\na similar package, or if your cloud provider does not support user metadata, then you must pre-configure a Windows image\nwith the required WinRM setup and make Brooklyn use this image.\nIf the configuration options userMetadata or userMetadataString are used on the location, then this will override\nthe default setup script. This allows one to supply a custom setup script. However, if userMetadata contains something\nelse then the setup will not be done and the VM may not not be accessible remotely over WinRM.\nCredentials issue requiring special configuration\nWhen a script is run over WinRM over HTTP, the credentials under which the script are run are marked as\n'remote' credentials, which are prohibited from running certain security-related operations. This may prevent certain\noperations. The installer from Microsoft SQL Server is known to fail in this case, for example. For a workaround, please\nrefer to How and Why to re-authenticate withing a powershell script \nabove.\nWebServiceException: Could not send Message\nWe detected a WebServiceException and different SocketException\nduring deployment of long lasting Application Blueprint against VcloudDirector.\nLaunching the blueprint bellow was giving constantly this type of error on launch step.\nservices:\n  type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.VanillaWindowsProcess\n  brooklyn.config:\n    pre.install.command: echo preInstallCommand\n    install.command: echo installCommand > C:\\\\install.txt\n    post.install.command: echo postInstallCommand\n    customize.command: echo customizeCommand\n    pre.launch.command: echo preLaunchCommand\n    launch.powershell.command: |\n      Start-Sleep -s 400\n      Write-Host Test Completed\n    post.launch.command: echo postLaunchCommand\n    checkRunning.command: echo checkRunningCommand\n    stop.command: echo stopCommand\nWith series of tests we concluded that on the Vcloud Director environment we were using\na restart was happening ~2 minutes after the VM is provisioned.\nLogging in the host and search for System event of type 1074 in Windows Event Viewer, we found two 1074 events where the second one was\nThe process C:\\Windows\\system32\\winlogon.exe (W2K12-STD) has initiated the restart of computer WIN-XXXX on behalf of user\nNT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM for the following reason: Operating System: Upgrade (Planned) Reason Code: 0x80020003 Shutdown Type: restart Comment:\nNormally on other clouds only one restart event is registered and the first time winrm connection is made the Windows VM is ready for use. \nFor this particular case when you want this second restart to finish we made waitWindowsToStart location parameter\nwhich basically adds additional check assuring the Windows VM provisioning is done.\nFor example when using waitWindowsToStart: 5m location parameter, Apache Brooklyn will wait 5 minutes to see if a disconnect occurs.\nIf it does, then it will again wait 5m for the machine to come back up.\nThe default behaviour in Apache Brooklyn is to consider provisioning done on the first successful winrm connection, without waiting for restart. \nTo determine whether you should use this parameter you should carefully inspect how the image you choose to provision is behaving.\nIf the description above matches your case and you are getting connection failure message in the middle of the installation process for your blueprints,\na restart probably occurred and you should try this parameter.\nBefore using this parameter we advice to check whether this is really your case.\nTo verify the behavior check as described above.\nAMIs not found\nIf using the imageId of a Windows community AMI, you may find that the AMI is deleted after a few weeks.\nSee Windows AMIs on AWS above.\nVM Provisioning Times Out\nIn some environments, provisioning of Windows VMs can take a very long time to return a usable VM.\nIf the image is old, it may install many security updates (and reboot several times) before it is\nusable.\nOn a VMware vCloud Director environment, the guest customizations can cause the VM to reboot (sometimes\nseveral times) before the VM is usable.\nThis could cause the WinRM connection attempts to timeout. The location configuration option \nwaitForWinRmAvailable defaults to 30m (i.e. 30 minutes). This can be increased if required.\nIncorrectly prepared Windows template can cause the deployment to time-out expecting an interaction by the user.\nYou can verify if this is the case by RDP to the deployment which is taking to much time to complete. \nIt is recommended to manually deploy a single VM for every newly created Windows template to verify that it can be\nused for unattended installations and it doesn't wait and/or require an input by the user.\nSee Windows template settings for an Unattended Installation under Known Limitations below. \nWindows log files\nDetails of the commands executed, and their results, can be found in the Brooklyn log and in the Brooklyn \nweb-console's activity view. \nThere will also be log files on the Windows Server. System errors in Windows are usually reported in the Windows Event Log -see https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766042.aspx \nfor more information.\nAdditional logs may be created by some Windows programs. For example, MSSQL creates a log in \n%programfiles%\\Microsoft SQL Server\\130\\Setup Bootstrap\\Log\\ - for more information see \nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143702.aspx.\nKnown Limitations\nWinRM 2.0 supports encryption mechanisms on top of HTTP. However those are not supported in Apache Brooklyn.\nFor production adoptions please make sure you follow Microsoft Guidelines https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee309366(v=vs.85).aspx\nApache Brooklyn limitations on using WinRM over HTTP and HTTPS\nBy default Apache Brooklyn is currently using unencrypted HTTP for WinRM communication. It does not support encrypted HTTP for WinRM.\nHTTPS is supported but there is no mechanism of specifying which certificates to trust.\nCurrently Apache Brooklyn will accept any certificate used in a HTTPS WinRM connection.\nIncorrect Exit Codes\nSome limitations with WinRM (or at least the chosen WinRM Client!) are listed below:\nSingle-line Powershell files\nWhen a Powershell file contains just a single command, the execution of that file over WinRM returns exit code 0\neven if the command fails! This is the case for even simple examples like exit 1 or thisFileDoesNotExist.exe.\nA workaround is to add an initial command, for example:\nWrite-Host dummy line for workaround \nexit 1\nDirect Configuration of Powershell commands\nIf a command is directly configured with Powershell that includes exit, the return code over WinRM\nis not respected. For example, the command below will receive an exit code of 0.\nlaunch.powershell.command: |\n  echo first\n  exit 1\nDirect Configuration of Batch commands\nIf a command is directly configured with a batch exit, the return code over WinRM\nis not respected. For example, the command below will receive an exit code of 0.\nlaunch.command: exit /B 1\nNon-zero Exit Code Returned as One\nIf a batch or Powershell file exits with an exit code greater than one (or negative), this will \nbe reported as 1 over WinRM.\nWe advise you to use native commands (non-powershell ones) since executing it as a native command\nwill return the exact exit code rather than 1.\nFor instance if you have installmssql.ps1 script use install.command: powershell -command \"C:\\\\installmssql.ps1\"\nrather than using install.powershell.command: \"C:\\\\installmssql.ps1\"\nThe first will give you an exact exit code rather than 1\nPowerShell \"Preparing modules for first use\"\nThe first command executed over WinRM has been observed to include stderr saying \"Preparing \nmodules for first use\", such as that below:\nSystem.Management.Automation.PSCustomObjectSystem.Object1Preparing modules for first use.0-1-1Completed-1 2Preparing modules for first use.0-1-1Completed-1 \nThe command still succeeded. This has only been observed on private clouds (e.g. not on\nAWS). It could be related to the specific Windows images in use. It is recommended that \nVM images are prepared carefully, e.g. so that security patches are up-to-date and the\nVM is suitably initialised.\nWinRM executeScript failed: httplib.BadStatusLine: ''\nAs described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BROOKLYN-173, a failure has been\nobserved where the 10 attempts to execute the command over WinRM failed with:\nhttplib.BadStatusLine: ''\nSubsequently retrying the command worked. It is unclear what caused the failure, but could \nhave been that the Windows VM was not yet in the right state.\nOne possible workaround is to ensure the Windows VM is in a good state for immediate use (e.g. \nsecurity updates are up-to-date). Another option is to increase the number of retries, \nwhich defaults to 10. This is a configuration option on the machine location, so can be set on\nthe location's brooklyn.properties or in the YAML: \nexecTries: 20\nDirect Configuration of Multi-line Batch Commands Not Executed\nIf a command is directly configured with multi-line batch commands, then only the first line \nwill be executed. For example the command below will only output \"first\":\nlaunch.command: |\n  echo first\n  echo second\nThe workaround is to write a file with the batch commands, have that file uploaded, and execute it.\nNote this is not done automatically because that could affect the capture and returning\nof the exit code for the commands executed.\nInstall location\nWork is required to better configure a default install location on the VM (e.g. so that \nenvironment variables are set). The installation pattern for linux-based blueprints,\nof using brooklyn-managed-processes/installs, is not used or recommended on Windows.\nFiles will be uploaded to C:\\ if no explicit directory is supplied, which is untidy, \nunnecessarily exposes the scripts to the user, and could cause conflicts if multiple \nentities are installed.\nBlueprint authors are strongly encourages to explicitly specific directories for file\nuploads and in their Powershell scripts.\nWindows template settings for an Unattended Installation\nWindows template needs certain configuration to be applied to prevent windows setup UI from being displayed.\nThe default behavior is to display it if there are incorrect or empty settings. Showing Setup UI will prevent the proper\ndeployment, because it will expect interaction by the user such as agreeing on the license agreement or some of the setup dialogs.\nDetailed instruction how to prepare an Unattended installation are provided at https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722411%28v=ws.10%29.aspx.\n"},"blueprints/test/":{"url":"blueprints/test/","title":"Testing YAML Blueprints","keywords":"","body":"Brooklyn provides a selection of test entities which can be used to validate Blueprints via YAML. The basic building block is a TargetableTestComponent, which is used to resolve a target. There are two different groups of entities that inherit from TargetableTestComponent. The first is structural, which effects how the tests are run, for example by affecting the order they are run in. The second group is validation, which is used to confirm the application is deployed as intended, for example by checking some sensor value.\nStructural test entities include:\n\nTestCase  - starts child entities sequentially.\nParallelTestCase - starts child entities in parallel.\nLoopOverGroupMembersTestCase - creates a TargetableTestComponent for each member of a group.\nInfrastructureDeploymentTestCase - will create the specified Infrastructure and then deploy the target entity specifications there.\n\nValidation test entities include:\n\nTestSensor - perform assertion on a specified sensor.\nTestEffector - perform assertion on response to effector call.\nTestHttpCall - perform assertion on response to specified HTTP GET Request.\nTestSshCommand - test assertions on the result of an ssh command on the same machine as the target entity.\nTestWinrmCommand - test assertions on the result of a WinRM command on the same machine as the target entity.\nTestEndpointReachable - assert that a TCP endpoint is reachable. The endpoint can be in a \nnumber of different formats: a string in the form of ip:port or URI format; or a \ncom.google.common.net.HostAndPort instance; or a java.net.URI instance; or a java.net.URL instance.\n\nTargetableTestComponents can be chained together, with the target being inherited by the components children. For example, a ParallelTestCase could be created that has a TestHttpCall as a child. As long as the TestHttpCall itself does not have a target, it will use the target of it's parent, ParallelTestCase.

This section of the documentation is intended to show a complete, advanced example of a YAML blueprint.\nThe intention is that this example is used to learn the more in-depth concepts, and also to serve as a reference when writing your own blueprints. This page will first explain what the example application is and how to run it, then it will spotlight interesting features.\nPlease note, there is now a much more up-to-date ELK blueprint that can be found here. We've using an older version of this in the tutorial as it highlights some key Brooklyn concepts.\nELK Stack Example\nThis example demonstrates the deployment of an ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana), using the provided blueprint to deploy, install, run and manage all three. Briefly, the component parts are:\n\nElasticsearch: A clustered search engine\nLogstash: Collects, parses and stores logs. For our example it will store logs in Elasticsearch\nKibana: A web front end to Elasticsearch\n\nWe also deploy a simple webserver whose logs will be collected.\n\nTomcat 8: Web server whose logs will be stored in Elasticsearch by Logstash.\n\nFor more about the ELK stack, please see the documentation here.\nThe Blueprints\n\nThere are four blueprints that make up this application. Each of them are used to add one or more catalog items to Brooklyn. You can find them below:\n\nElasticsearch\nLogstash\nKibana\nELK\n\nRunning the example\nFirst, add all four blueprints to the Brooklyn Catalog. This can be done by clicking the 'Catalog' tab, clicking the '+'\n symbol and pasting the YAML. Once this is done, click the 'Application' tab, then the '+' button to bring up the add \napplication wizard. A new Catalog application will be available called 'ELK Stack'. Using the add application wizard, \nyou should be able to deploy an ELK stack to a location of your choosing.  Alternatively use the br Brooklyn\ncommand line tool and add the files with br catalog add.\nExploring the example\nAfter the application has been deployed, you can ensure it is working as expected by checking the following:\n\nThere is a Kibana sensor called main.uri, the value of which points to the Kibana front end. You can explore this \nfront end, and observe the logs stored in Elasticsearch. Many Brooklyn applications have a main.uri set to point you \nin the right direction.\nYou can also use the Elasticsearch REST API to explore further. The Elasticsearch Cluster entity has a urls.http.list \nsensor. Using a host:port from that list you will be able to access the REST API. The following URL will give you the \nstate of the cluster http:///_cluster/health?pretty=true. As you can see the number_of_nodes is \ncurrently 2, indicating that the Elasticsearch nodes are communicating with each other.\n\nInteresting Feature Spotlight\nWe will mainly focus on the Elasticsearch blueprint, and will be clear when another blueprint is being discussed. This blueprint describes a cluster of Elasticsearch nodes. \nProvisioning Properties\nOur Elasticsearch blueprint has a few requirements of the location in which it is run. Firstly, it must be run on an\nUbuntu machine as the example has been written specifically for this OS. Secondly, two ports must opened to ensure\nthat the entities can be accessed from the outside world. Both of these requirements are configured via \nprovisioning.properties as follows:\nbrooklyn.config:\n  elasticsearch.http.port: 9220\n  elasticsearch.tcp.port: 9330\n  provisioning.properties:\n    osFamily: ubuntu\n    inboundPorts:\n    - $brooklyn:config(\"elasticsearch.http.port\")\n    - $brooklyn:config(\"elasticsearch.tcp.port\")\n\nVanillaSoftwareProcess\nWhen composing a YAML blueprint, the VanillaSoftwareProcess is a very useful entity to be aware of. \nA VanillaSoftwareProcess will instruct Brooklyn to provision an instance, and run a series of shell \ncommands to setup, run, monitor and teardown your program. The commands are specified as configuration \non the VanillaSoftwareProcess and there are several available. We will spotlight a few now. To simplify\n this blueprint, we have specified ubuntu only installs so that our commands can be tailored to this \n system (e.g. use apt-get rather than yum).\nCustomize Command\nThe Customize Command is run after the application has been installed but before it is run. It is the perfect\n place to create and amend config files. Please refer to the following section of the Elasticsearch blueprint:\ncustomize.command: |\n  sudo rm -fr sudo tee /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml\n  echo discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false | sudo tee -a /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml\n  echo discovery.zen.ping.unicast.enabled: true | sudo tee -a /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml\n  echo discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ${URLS_WITH_BRACKETS} | sudo tee -a /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml\n  echo http.port: ${ES_HTTP_PORT} | sudo tee -a /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml\n  echo transport.tcp.port: ${ES_TCP_PORT} | sudo tee -a /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml\n  echo network.host: ${IP_ADDRESS} | sudo tee -a /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml\n\nThe purpose of this section is to create a YAML file with all of the required configuration. We use the YAML \nliteral style | indicator to write a multi line command. We start our series of commands by using the rm command to remove the \nprevious config file. We then use echo and tee to create the new config file and insert the config. Part \nof the configuration is a list of all hosts that is set on the parent entity- this is done by using a combination\n of the component and  attributeWhenReady DSL commands. More on how this is generated later.\nCheck running\nAfter an app is installed and run, this command is scheduled to run regularly and used to populate the service.isUp \nsensor. If this command is not specified, or returns an exit code of anything other than zero, then Brooklyn will \nassume that your entity has failed and will display the fire status symbol. Please refer to the following section \nof the Elasticsearch blueprint:\ncheckRunning.command: sudo systemctl status kibana.service\n\nThere are many different ways to implement this command. For this example, we are simply using the systemctl status \nof the appropriate service.\nEnrichers\nElasticsearch URLS\nTo ensure that all Elasticsearch nodes can communicate with each other they need to be configured with the TCP URL \nof all other nodes. Similarly, the Logstash instances need to be configured with all the HTTP URLs of the Elasticsearch \nnodes. The mechanism for doing this is the same, and involves using Transformers, Aggregators and Joiners, as follows:\nbrooklyn.enrichers:\n  - type: org.apache.brooklyn.enricher.stock.Transformer\n    brooklyn.config:\n      enricher.sourceSensor: $brooklyn:sensor(\"host.subnet.address\")\n      enricher.targetSensor: $brooklyn:sensor(\"url.tcp\")\n      enricher.targetValue: $brooklyn:formatString(\"%s:%s\", $brooklyn:attributeWhenReady(\"host.subnet.address\"), $brooklyn:config(\"elasticsearch.tcp.port\"))\n\nIn this example, we take the host.subnet.address and append the TCP port, outputting the result as url.tcp. \nAfter this has been done, we now need to collect all the URLs into a list in the Cluster entity, as follows:\nbrooklyn.enrichers:\n  - type: org.apache.brooklyn.enricher.stock.Aggregator\n    brooklyn.config:\n      enricher.sourceSensor: $brooklyn:sensor(\"url.tcp\")\n      enricher.targetSensor: $brooklyn:sensor(\"urls.tcp.list\")\n      enricher.aggregating.fromMembers: true\n\nIn the preceding example, we aggregated all of the TCP URLs generated in the early example. \nThese are then stored in a sensor called urls.tcp.list. This list is then joined together into one long string:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.enricher.stock.Joiner\n  brooklyn.config:\n    enricher.sourceSensor: $brooklyn:sensor(\"urls.tcp.list\")\n    enricher.targetSensor: $brooklyn:sensor(\"urls.tcp.string\")\n    uniqueTag: urls.quoted.string\n\nFinally, the string has brackets added to the start and end:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.enricher.stock.Transformer\n  brooklyn.config:\n    enricher.sourceSensor: $brooklyn:sensor(\"urls.tcp.string\")\n    enricher.targetSensor: $brooklyn:sensor(\"urls.tcp.withBrackets\")\n    enricher.targetValue: $brooklyn:formatString(\"[%s]\", $brooklyn:attributeWhenReady(\"urls.tcp.string\"))\n\nThe resulting sensor will be called urls.tcp.withBrackets and will be used by all Elasticsearch nodes during setup.\nKibana URL\nKibana also needs to be configured such that it can access the Elasticsearch cluster. However, Kibana can\n only be configured to point at one Elasticsearch instance. To enable this, we use another enricher in the \n cluster to select the first URL from the list, as follows:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.enricher.stock.Aggregator\n  brooklyn.config:\n    enricher.sourceSensor: $brooklyn:sensor(\"host.subnet.address\")\n    enricher.targetSensor: $brooklyn:sensor(\"host.address.first\")\n    enricher.aggregating.fromMembers: true\n    enricher.transformation:\n     $brooklyn:object:\n       type: \"org.apache.brooklyn.util.collections.CollectionFunctionals$FirstElementFunction\"\n\nSimilar to the above Aggregator, this Aggregator collects all the URLs from the members of the cluster. \nHowever, this Aggregator specifies a transformation. In this instance a transformation is a Java class that \nimplements a Guava Function , ?>>, i.e. a function that takes in a collection and \nreturns something. In this case we specify the FirstElementFunction from the CollectionFunctionals to ensure \nthat we only get the first member of the URL list.\nLatches\nIn the ELK blueprint, there is a good example of a latch. Latches are used to force an entity to wait until \ncertain conditions are met before continuing. For example:\n- type: kibana-standalone\n  id: kibana\n  name: Kibana Server\n  latch.customize: $brooklyn:component(\"es\").attributeWhenReady(\"service.isUp\")\n\nThis latch is used to stop Kibana customizing until the Elasticsearch cluster is up. We do this to ensure \nthat the URL sensors have been setup, so that they can be passed into Kibana during the customization phase.\nLatches can also be used to control how many entities can execute the same step at any given moment. When\na latch is given the value of a MaxConcurrencySensor it will unblock execution only when there are\navailable \"slots\" to execute (think of it as a semaphore). For example to let a single entity execute the\nlaunch step of the start effector:\nservices:\n- type: cluster\n\n  brooklyn.initializers:\n  - type: org.apache.brooklyn.core.sensor.MaxConcurrencySensor\n    brooklyn.config:\n      name: single-executor\n      latch.concurrency.max: 1\n\n  brooklyn.config: \n    initialSize: 10\n    memberSpec:\n      $brooklyn:entitySpec:\n        type: vanilla-bash-server\n        brooklyn.config:\n          launch.command: sleep 2\n          checkRunning.command: true\n          latch.launch: $brooklyn:parent().attributeWhenReady(\"single-executor\")\n\nIt's important to note that the above setup is not reentrant. This means that users should be careful to\navoid deadlocks. For example having a start and launch latches against the single-executor from above.\nThe launch latch will block forever since the start latch already would've acquired the free slot.\nChild entities\nThe ELK blueprint also contains a good example of a child entity.\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.tomcat.Tomcat8Server\n  brooklyn.config:\n    children.startable.mode: background_late\n  ...\n  brooklyn.children:\n  - type: logstash-child\n\nIn this example, a logstash-child is started as a child of the parent Tomcat server. The Tomcat server needs \nto be configured with a children.startable.mode to inform Brooklyn when to bring up the child. In this case\n we have selected background so that the child is disassociated from the parent entity, and late to specify that\n  the parent entity should start before we start the child.\nThe example also shows how to configure Logstash inputs and filters, if necessary, for a particular application, \nin this case Tomcat.\n- type: logstash-child\n  name: Logstash\n  brooklyn.config:\n    logstash.elasticsearch.hosts: $brooklyn:entity(\"es\").attributeWhenReady(\"urls.http.withBrackets\")\n    logstash.config.input:\n      $brooklyn:formatString:\n      - |\n        input {\n          file {\n            path => \"%s/logs/localhost_access_log.*\"\n            start_position => \"beginning\"\n          }\n        }\n      - $brooklyn:entity(\"tomcat\").attributeWhenReady(\"run.dir\")\n    logstash.config.filter: |\n      filter {\n        grok {\n          match => { \"message\" => \"%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}\" }\n        }\n        date {\n          match => [ \"timestamp\" , \"dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z\" ]\n        }\n      }\n\nConfiguring an appropriate visualisation on the Kibana server (access it via the URL on the summary tab for \nthat entity) allows a dashboard to be created such as\n\n"},"blueprints/blueprinting-tips.html":{"url":"blueprints/blueprinting-tips.html","title":"Blueprinting Tips","keywords":"","body":"YAML Recommended\nThe recommended way to write a blueprint is as a YAML file. This is true both for building\nan application out of existing blueprints, and for building new integrations.\nThe use of Java is reserved for those use-cases where the provisioning or configuration logic \nis very complicated.\nBe Familiar with Brooklyn\nBe familiar with the stock entities available in Brooklyn. For example, prove you understandthe concepts by making a deployment of a cluster of Tomcat servers before you begin writing your \nown blueprints.\nAsk For Help\nAsk for help early. The community is keen to help, and also keen to find out what people find \nhard and how people use the product. Such feedback is invaluable for improving future versions.\nFaster Dev-Test\nWriting a blueprint is most efficient and simple when testing is fast, and when testing is\ndone incrementally as features of the blueprint are written.\nThe slowest stages of deploying a blueprint are usually VM provisioning and downloading/installing\nof artifacts (e.g. RPMs, zip files, etc).\nOptions for speeding up provisioning include those below.\nDeploying to Bring Your Own Nodes (BYON)\nA BYON location can be defined, which avoids the time \nrequired to provision VMs. This is fast, but has the downside that artifacts installed during a \nprevious run can interfere with subsequent runs.\nA variant of this is to use Vagrant (e.g. with VirtualBox) \nto create VMs on your local machine, and to use these as the target for a BYON location.\nThese VMs should mirror the target environment as much as possible.\nDeploying to the \"localhost\" location\nThis is fast and simple, but has some obvious downsides:\n\nArtifacts are installed directly on your desktop/server.\n\nThe artifacts installed during previous runs can interfere with subsequent runs.\n\nSome entities require sudo rights, which must be granted to the user running Brooklyn.\n\n\nDeploying to Clocker\nDocker containers provide a convenient way to test blueprints (and also to run blueprints in\nproduction!).\nThe Clocker project allows the simple setup of Docker Engine(s), and for Docker\ncontainers to be used instead of VMs. For testing, this allows each run to start from a fresh \ncontainer (i.e. no install artifacts from previous runs), while taking advantage of the speed\nof starting containers.\nLocal Repository of Install Artifacts\nTo avoid re-downloading install artifacts on every run, these can be saved to ~/.brooklyn/repository/.\nThe file structure is a sub-directory with the entity's simple name, then a sub-directory with the\nversion number, and then the files to be downloaded. For example, \n~/.brooklyn/repository/TomcatServer/7.0.56/apache-tomcat-7.0.56.tar.gz.\nIf possible, synchronise this directory with your test VMs. \nRe-install on BYON\nIf using BYON or localhost, the install artifacts will by default be installed to a directory like\n/tmp/brooklyn-myname/installs/. If install completed successfully, then the install stage will \nbe subsequently skipped (a marker file being used to indicate completion). To re-test the install \nphase, delete the install directory (e.g. delete /tmp/brooklyn-myname/installs/TomcatServer_7.0.56/).\nWhere installation used something like apt-get install or yum install, then re-testing the\ninstall phase will require uninstalling these artifacts manually.\nMonitoring and Managing Applications\nThink about what it really means for an application to be running. The out-of-the-box default \nfor a software process is the lowest common denominator: that the process is still running. \nConsider checking that the app responds over HTTP etc.\nIf you have control of the app code, then consider adding an explicit health check URL that\ndoes more than basic connectivity tests. For example, can it reach the database, message broker,\nand other components that it will need for different operations.\nWriting Composite Blueprints\nWrite everything in discrete chunks that can be composed into larger pieces. Do not write a single \nmega-blueprint. For example, ensure each component is added to the catalog independently, along \nwith a blueprint for the composite app.\nExperiment with lots of small blueprints to test independent areas before combining them into the \nreal thing.\nWriting Entity Tests\nUse the test framework to write test cases. This will make \nautomated (regression) testing easier, and will allow others to easily confirm that the entity \nworks in their environment.\nIf using Maven/Gradle then use the Brooklyn Maven plugin \nto test blueprints at build time.\nCustom Entity Development\nIf writing a custom integration, the following recommendations may be useful:\n\nAlways be comfortable installing and running the process yourself before attempting to automate \nit.\n\nFor the software to be installed, use its Installation and Admin guides to ensure best practices\nare being followed. Use blogs and advice from experts, when available.\n\nWhere there is a choice of installation approaches, use the approach that is most appropriate for\nproduction use-cases (even if this is harder to test on locahost). For example, \nprefer the use of RPMs versus unpacking zip files, and prefer the use of services versus invoking\na bin/start script.\n\nEnsure every step is scriptable (e.g. manual install does not involve using a text editor to \nmodify configuration files, or clicking on things in a web-console).\n\nWrite scripts (or Chef recipes, or Puppet manifests, etc), and test these by executing manually. \nOnly once these work in isolation, add them to the entity blueprint.\n\nExternalise the configuration where appropriate. For example, if there is a configuration file\nthen include a config key for the URL of the configuration file to use. Consider using FreeMarker\ntemplating for such configuration files.\n\nFocus on a single OS distro/version first, and clearly document these assumptions.\n\nBreakdown the integration into separate components, where possible (and thus develop/test them separately). \nFor example, if deploying a MongoDB cluster then first focus on single-node MongoDB, and then make that\nconfigurable and composable for a cluster.\n\nWhere appropriate, share the new entity with the Brooklyn community so that it can be reviewed, \ntested and improved by others in the community!\n\n\nCloud Portability\nYou get a lot of support out-of-the-box for deploying blueprints to different clouds. The points \nbelow may also be of help:\n\nTest (and regression test) on each target cloud.\n\nBe aware that images on different clouds can be very different. For example, two CentOS 6.6 VMs \nmight have different pre-installed libraries, different default iptables or SE Linux settings,\ndifferent repos, different sudo configuration, etc.\n\nDifferent clouds handle private and public IPs differently. One must be careful about which \naddress to advertise to for use by other entities.\n\nVMs on some clouds may not have a well-configured hostname (e.g. ping $(hostname) can fail).\n\nVMs in different clouds have a different number of NICs. This is important when choosing whether\nto listen on 0.0.0.0 or on a specific NIC.\n\n\nInvestigating Errors\nALWAYS keep logs when there is an error.\nSee the Troubleshooting guide for more information. \n"},"locations/":{"url":"locations/","title":"Deploying Blueprint","keywords":"","body":"Locations are the environments to which Brooklyn deploys applications.

Such stdout risks interfering with the response parsing in some blueprints.\nFor example, if configuring the VM to write out \"Last login\" information, this should be done for only \n\"interactive\" shells (see Stackoverflow for more details).\nPasswordless Sudo\nDoes passwordless sudo work?\nTry executing:\nsudo whoami\nSee Passwordless Sudo.\nAdvertised Addresses\nHostname Resolves Locally\nDoes the hostname known at the box resolve at the box?\nTry executing:\nping $(hostname)\nif not, consider setting generate.hostname: true in the location config, for jclouds-based locations.\nIP Resolves Locally\nFor the IP address advertised in Brooklyn using the sensor host.addresses.private (or host.subnet.address), \ncan the machine reach that IP?\nGet the sensor value, and then try executing:\nping ${PRIVATE_IP}\nIs there a public IP (advertised using the sensor host.addresses.public, or host.address), and can the \nmachine reach it?\nGet the sensor value, and then try executing:\nping ${PUBLIC_IP}\nNetworking\nPublic Internet Access\nCan the machine reach the public internet, and does DNS resolve?\nTry executing:\nping www.example.org\nMachine's Hostname in DNS\nIs the machine hostname well-known?

Some blueprints may include registration\nwith an appropriate DNS server. Some clouds do this automatically.\nReachability\nWhen provisioning two machines, can these two machines reach each other on the expected IP(s) and hostname(s)?\nTry using ping from one machine to another using the public or subnet ip or hostname.\nHowever, note that ping requires access over ICMP, which may be disabled.

For example, a vCloud (vCD) template can have guest customization that will change\nthe root password. This setting tells Apache Brooklyn to only use the given password, rather than the initial \nrandomly generated password that vCD returns. Without this property, there is a race for such templates:\ndoes Brooklyn manage to create the admin user before the guest customization changes the login and reboots,\nor is the password reset first (the latter means Brooklyn can never ssh to the VM). With this property, \nBrooklyn will always wait for guest customization to complete before it is able to ssh at all. In such\ncases, it is also recommended to use useJcloudsSshInit=false.)\nFollowing a successful logon, Brooklyn performs the following steps to configure the machine:\n\ncreates a new user with the same name as the user brooklyn is running as locally\n(this can be overridden with user, below).\n\ninstall the local user's ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub as an authorized_keys on the new machine,\nto make it easy for the operator to ssh in\n(override with privateKeyFile; or if there is no id_{r,d}sa{,.pub} an ad hoc keypair will be generated\nfor the regular Brooklyn user;\nif there is a passphrase on the key, this must be supplied)  \n\ngive sudo access to the newly created user (override with grantUserSudo: false)\n\ndisable direct root login to the machine\n\n\nThese steps can be skipped or customized as described below.\njclouds Config Keys\nThe following is a subset of the most commonly used configuration keys used to customize \ncloud provisioning.\nFor more keys and more detail on the keys below, see \nJcloudsLocationConfig.\nVM Creation\n\nMost providers require exactly one of either region (e.g. us-east-1) or endpoint (the URL, usually for private cloud deployments)\n\nHardware requirements can be specified, including \nminRam, minCores, minDisk and os64Bit; or as a specific hardwareId\n\nVM image constraints can be set using osFamily (e.g. Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, RHEL)\nand osVersionRegex, or specific VM images can be specified using imageId or imageNameRegex\n\nSpecific VM images can be specified using imageId or imageNameRegex\n\nSpecific Security Groups can be specified using securityGroups, as a list of strings (the existing security group names),\nor inboundPorts can be set, as a list of numeric ports (selected clouds only)\n\nWhere a key pair is registered with a target cloud for logging in to machines,\nBrooklyn can be configured to request this when provisioning VMs by setting keyPair (selected clouds only). \nNote that if this keyPair does not correspond your default ~/.ssh/id_rsa, you must typically \nalso specify the corresponding loginUser.privateKeyFile as a file or URL accessible from Brooklyn.\n\nA specific VM name (often the hostname) base to be used can be specified by setting groupId.\nBy default, this name is constructed based on the entity which is creating it,\nincluding the ID of the app and of the entity.\n(As many cloud portals let you filter views, this can help find a specific entity or all machines for a given application.)\nFor more sophisticated control over host naming, you can supply a custom \nCloudMachineNamer,\nfor example\ncloudMachineNamer: CustomMachineNamer.\nCustomMachineNamer\nwill use the entity's name or following a template you supply.\nOn many clouds, a random suffix will be appended to help guarantee uniqueness;\nthis can be removed by setting vmNameSaltLength: 0 (selected clouds only).\n\n\nA DNS domain name where this host should be placed can be specified with domainName\n(in selected clouds only)\n\nUser metadata can be attached using the syntax userMetadata: { key: value, key2: \"value 2\" } \n(or userMetadata=key=value,key2=\"value 2\" in a properties file)\n\nBy default, several pieces of user metadata are set to correlate VMs with Brooklyn entities,\nprefixed with brooklyn-.\nThis user metadata can be omitted by setting includeBrooklynUserMetadata: false.\n\nYou can specify the number of attempts Brooklyn should make to create\nmachines with machineCreateAttempts (jclouds only). This is useful as an efficient low-level fix\nfor those occasions when cloud providers give machines that are dead on arrival.\nYou can of course also resolve it at a higher level with a policy such as \nServiceRestarter.\n\nIf you want to investigate failures, set destroyOnFailure: false\nto keep failed VM's around. (You'll have to manually clean them up.)\nThe default is false: if a VM fails to start, or is never ssh'able, then the VM will be terminated.\n\nYou can set useMachinePublicAddressAsPrivateAddress to true to overwrite the VMs private IP with its public IP. This is useful as it can be difficult to get VMs communicating via the private IPs they are assigned in some clouds.  Using this config, blueprints which use private IPs can still be deployed to these clouds.\nOS Setup\n\nuser and password can be used to configure the operating user created on cloud-provisioned machines\n\nThe loginUser config key (and subkeys) control the initial user to log in as,\nin cases where this cannot be discovered from the cloud provider\n\nPrivate keys can be specified using privateKeyFile; \nthese are not copied to provisioned machines, but are required if using a local public key\nor a pre-defined authorized_keys on the server.\n(For more information on SSH keys, see here.) \n\nIf there is a passphrase on the key file being used, you must supply it to Brooklyn for it to work, of course!\nprivateKeyPassphrase does the trick (as in brooklyn.location.jclouds.privateKeyPassphrase, or other places\nwhere privateKeyFile is valid).  If you don't like keys, you can just use a plain old password.\n\nPublic keys can be specified using publicKeyFile, \nalthough these can usually be omitted if they follow the common pattern of being\nthe private key file with the suffix .pub appended.\n(It is useful in the case of loginUser.publicKeyFile, where you shouldn't need,\nor might not even have, the private key of the root user when you log in.)\n\nProvide a list of URLs to public keys in extraSshPublicKeyUrls,\nor the data of one key in extraSshPublicKeyData,\nto have additional public keys added to the authorized_keys file for logging in.\n(This is supported in most but not all locations.)\n\nUse dontCreateUser to have Brooklyn run as the initial loginUser (usually root),\nwithout creating any other user.\n\nA post-provisioning setup.script can be specified to run an additional script, before making the Location \navailable to entities. This may take the form of a URL of a script or a data URI.\nNote that if using a data URI it is usually a good idea to base64 this string to escape problem characters\nin more complex scripts. The base64 encoded script should then be prefixed with data:text/plain;base64, to denote this. \nFor example if you wanted to disable a yum repository called reponame prior to using the machine, you could use the following command:\nsudo yum-config-manager --disable reponame\nBase64 encoding can be done with a with a tool such as this or a linux command such as:\necho \"sudo yum-config-manager --disable reponame\" | base64\nWith the base64 prefix this would then look like this:\nsetup.script: data:text/plain;base64,c3VkbyB5dW0tY29uZmlnLW1hbmFnZXIgLS1kaXNhYmxlIHJlcG9uYW1l\nThe setup.script can also take FreeMarker variables in a setup.script.vars\nproperty. Variables are set in the format key1:value1,key2:value2 and used in the form ${key1}. So for the above example:\nsetup.script.vars: repository:reponame\nthen\nsetup.script: data:sudo yum-config-manager --disable ${repository}\nor encoded in base64:\nsetup.script: data:text/plain;base64,c3VkbyB5dW0tY29uZmlnLW1hbmFnZXIgLS1kaXNhYmxlICR7cmVwb3NpdG9yeX0=\nThis enables the name of the repository to be passed in to the script.\n\nUse openIptables: true to automatically configure iptables, to open the TCP ports required by\nthe software process. One can alternatively use stopIptables: true to entirely stop the\niptables service.\n\nUse Entity configuration flag effector.add.openInboundPorts: true to add an effector for opening ports in a cloud Security Group.\nThe config is supported for all SoftwareProcessImpl implementations.\n\nUse installDevUrandom: true to fall back to using /dev/urandom rather than /dev/random. This setting\nis useful for cloud VMs where there is not enough random entropy, which can cause /dev/random to be\nextremely slow (causing ssh to be extremely slow to respond).\n\nUse useJcloudsSshInit: false to disable the use of the native jclouds support for initial commands executed \non the VM (e.g. for creating new users, setting root passwords, etc.). Instead, Brooklyn's ssh support will\nbe used. Timeouts and retries are more configurable within Brooklyn itself. Therefore this option is particularly \nrecommended when the VM startup is unusual (for example, if guest customizations will cause reboots and/or will \nchange login credentials).\n\nUse brooklyn.ssh.config.noDeleteAfterExec: true to keep scripts on the server after execution.\nThe contents of the scripts and the stdout/stderr of their execution are available in the Brooklyn web console,\nbut sometimes it can also be useful to have them on the box.\nThis setting prevents scripts executed on the VMs from being deleted on completion.\nNote that some scripts run periodically so this can eventually fill a disk; it should only be used for dev/test. \n\n\nCustom Template Options\njclouds supports many additional options for configuring how a virtual machine is created and deployed, many of which\nare for cloud-specific features and enhancements. Brooklyn supports some of these, but if what you are looking for is\nnot supported directly by Brooklyn, we instead offer a mechanism to set any parameter that is supported by the jclouds\ntemplate options for your cloud.\nPart of the process for creating a virtual machine is the creation of a jclouds TemplateOptions object. jclouds\nproviders extends this with extra options for each cloud - so when using the AWS provider, the object will be of\ntype AWSEC2TemplateOptions. By examining the source code,\nyou can see all of the options available to you.\nThe templateOptions config key takes a map. The keys to the map are method names, and Brooklyn will find the method on\nthe TemplateOptions instance; it then invokes the method with arguments taken from the map value. If a method takes a\nsingle parameter, then simply give the argument as the value of the key; if the method takes multiple parameters, the\nvalue of the key should be an array, containing the argument for each parameter.\nFor example, here is a complete blueprint that sets some AWS EC2 specific options:\nlocation: AWS_eu-west-1\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.EmptySoftwareProcess\n  provisioning.properties:\n    templateOptions:\n      subnetId: subnet-041c8373\n      mapNewVolumeToDeviceName: [\"/dev/sda1\", 100, true]\n      securityGroupIds: ['sg-4db68928']\nHere you can see that we set three template options:\n\nsubnetId is an example of a single parameter method. Brooklyn will effectively try to run the statement\ntemplateOptions.subnetId(\"subnet-041c88373\");\nmapNewVolumeToDeviceName is an example of a multiple parameter method, so the value of the key is an array.\nBrooklyn will effectively true to run the statement templateOptions.mapNewVolumeToDeviceName(\"/dev/sda1\", 100, true);\nsecurityGroupIds demonstrates an ambiguity between the two types; Brooklyn will first try to parse the value as\na multiple parameter method, but there is no method that matches this parameter. In this case, Brooklyn will next try\nto parse the value as a single parameter method which takes a parameter of type List; such a method does exist so\nthe operation will succeed.\n\nIf the method call cannot be matched to the template options available - for example if you are trying to set an AWS EC2\nspecific option but your location is an OpenStack cloud - then a warning is logged and the option is ignored.\nCloud Machine Naming\nThe name that Apache Brooklyn generates for your virtual machine will, by default, be based on your Apache Brooklyn server name and the IDs of the entities involved. This is the name you see in places such as the AWS console and will look something like:\nbrooklyn-o8jql4-machinename-rkix-tomcat-wi-nca6-14b\nIf you have created a lot of virtual machines, this kind of naming may not be helpful. This can be changed using the following YAML in your location's brooklyn.config:\ncloudMachineNamer: org.apache.brooklyn.core.location.cloud.names.CustomMachineNamer\ncustom.machine.namer.machine: My-Custom-Name-${entity.displayName}\nA FreeMarker format is used in custom.machine.namer.machine which can take values from places such as the launching entity or location.\nThe above example will create a name such as:\nMy-Custom-Name-Tomcat\nAllowing you to more easily identify your virtual machines.\nMore Details on Specific Clouds\nClouds vary in the format of the identity, credential, endpoint, and region.\nSome also have their own idiosyncracies.  More details for configuring some common clouds\nis included below. You may also find these sources helpful:\n\nThe template brooklyn.properties file\nin the Getting Started guide\ncontains numerous examples of configuring specific clouds,\nincluding the format of credentials and options for sometimes-fiddly private clouds.\nThe jclouds guides describes low-level configuration\nsometimes required for various clouds.\n\n\nsection: Amazon Web Services (AWS)\ntitle: Amazon Web Services\nsection_type: inline\nsection_position: 2\nAmazon Web Services (AWS)\nCredentials\nAWS has an \"access key\" and a \"secret key\", which correspond to Brooklyn's identity and credential\nrespectively.\nThese keys are the way for any programmatic mechanism to access the AWS API.\nTo generate an access key and a secret key, see jclouds instructions\nand AWS IAM instructions.\nAn example of the expected format is shown below:\nlocation:\n  jclouds:aws-ec2:\n    region: us-east-1\n    identity: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST\n    credential: abcdefghijklmnopqrstu+vwxyzabcdefghijklm\nUsers are strongly recommended to use \nexternalized configuration for better\ncredential management, for example using Vault.\nCommon Configuration Options\nBelow are examples of configuration options that use values specific to AWS EC2:\n\nThe region is the AWS region code.\nFor example, region: us-east-1. You can in-line the region name using the following format: jclouds:aws-ec2:us-east-1.\nA specific availability zone within the region can be specified by including its letter identifier as a suffix. \nFor example, region: us-east-1a.\n\nThe hardwareId is the instance type. For example,\nhardwareId: m4.large.\n\nThe imageId is the region-specific AMI id.\nFor example, imageId: us-east-1/ami-05ebd06c.\n\nThe securityGroups option takes one or more names of pre-existing \nsecurity groups.\nFor example, securityGroups: mygroup1 or securityGroups: [ mygroup1, mygroup2 ].\n\n\nUsing Subnets and Security Groups\nApache Brooklyn can run with AWS VPC and both public and private subnets.\nSimply provide the subnet-a1b2c3d4 as the networkName when deploying:\nlocation:\n  jclouds:aws-ec2:\n    region: us-west-1\n    networkName: subnet-a1b2c3d4   # use your subnet ID\nSubnets are typically used in conjunction with security groups.\nBrooklyn does not attempt to open additional ports\nwhen private subnets or security groups are supplied,\nso the subnet and ports must be configured appropriately for the blueprints being deployed.\nYou can configure a default security group with appropriate (or all) ports opened for\naccess from the appropriate (or all) CIDRs and security groups,\nor you can define specific securityGroups on the location\nor as provisioning.properties on the entities.\nMake sure that Brooklyn has access to the machines under management.\nThis includes SSH, which might be done with a public IP created with inbound access\non port 22 permitted for a CIDR range including the IP from which Brooklyn contacts it.\nAlternatively you can run Brooklyn on a machine in that same subnet, or\nset up a VPN or jumphost which Brooklyn will use.\nEC2 \"Classic\" Problems with VPC-only Hardware Instance Types\nIf you have a pre-2014 Amazon account, it is likely configured in some regions to run in \"EC2 Classic\" mode\nby default, instead of the more modern \"VPC\" default mode.  This can cause failures when requesting certain hardware\nconfigurations because many of the more recent hardware \"instance types\" only run in \"VPC\" mode.\nFor instance when requesting an instance with minRam: 8gb, Brooklyn may opt for an m4.large,\nwhich is a VPC-only instance type. If you are in a region configured to use \"EC2 Classic\" mode,\nyou may see a message such as this:\n400 VPCResourceNotSpecified: The specified instance type can only be used in a VPC.\nA subnet ID or network interface ID is required to carry out the request.\nThis is a limitation of \"legacy\" accounts.  The easiest fixes are either:\n\nspecify an instance type which is supported in classic, such as m3.xlarge (see below)\nmove to a different region where VPC is the default\n(eu-central-1 should work as it only offers VPC mode,\nirrespective of the age of your AWS account)\nget a new AWS account -- \"VPC\" will be the default mode\n(Amazon recommend this and if you want to migrate existing deployments\nthey provide detailed instructions)\n\nTo understand the situation, the following resources may be useful:\n\nBackground on VPC vs Classic:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html\nGood succinct answers to FAQs: http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/#Default_VPCs\nCheck if a region in your account is \"VPC\" or \"Classic\": http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/default-vpc.html#default-vpc-availability\nRegarding instance types:\nAll instance types: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types\nThose which require VPC: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html#vpc-only-instance-types\n\n\n\nIf you want to solve this problem with your existing account,\nyou can create a VPC and instruct Brooklyn to use it:\n\nUse the \"Start VPC Wizard\" option in the VPC dashboard,\nmaking sure it is for the right region, and selecting a \"Single Public Subnet\".\n(More information is in these AWS instructions.)\nOnce the VPC is created, open the \"Subnets\" view and modify the \"Public subnet\"\nso that it will \"Auto-assign Public IP\".\nNext click on the \"Security Groups\" and find the default security group for that VPC.\nModify its \"Inbound Rules\" to allow \"All traffic\" from \"Anywhere\".\n(Or for more secure options, see the instructions in the previous section,\n\"Using Subnets\".)\nFinally make a note of the subnet ID (e.g. subnet-a1b2c3d4) for use in Brooklyn.\n\nYou can then deploy blueprints to the subnet, allowing VPC hardware instance types,\nby specifying the subnet ID as the networkName in your YAML blueprint.\nThis is covered in the previous section, \"Using Subnets\".\nTidying up after jclouds\nSecurity groups are not always deleted by jclouds. This is due to a limitation in AWS (see\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCLOUDS-207). In brief, AWS prevents the security group\nfrom being deleted until there are no VMs using it. However, there is eventual consistency for\nrecording which VMs still reference those security groups: after deleting the VM, it can sometimes\ntake several minutes before the security group can be deleted. jclouds retries for 3 seconds, but\ndoes not block for longer.\nWhilst there is eventual consistency for recording which VMs still reference security groups, after deleting a VM, it can sometimes take several minutes before a security group can be deleted\nThere is utility written by Cloudsoft for deleting these unused resources:\nhttp://blog.abstractvisitorpattern.co.uk/2013/03/tidying-up-after-jclouds.html.\n\nsection: Azure Compute ARM\nsection_type: inline\nsection_position: 2\nAzure Compute ARM\nAzure Resource Manager (ARM) is a framework for deploying and managing applications across resources and managing groups of resources as single logical units on the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform.\nSetup the Azure credentials\nAzure CLI 2.0\nFirstly, install and configure Azure CLI following these steps.\nYou will need to obtain your subscription ID and tenant ID from Azure. To do this using the CLI, first, log in:\naz login\nOr, if you are already logged in, request an account listing:\naz account list\nIn either case, this will return a subscription listing, similar to that shown below.\n[\n  {\n    \"cloudName\": \"AzureCloud\",\n    \"id\": \"012e832d-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\",\n    \"isDefault\": true,\n    \"name\": \"QA Team\",\n    \"state\": \"Enabled\",\n    \"tenantId\": \"ba85e8cd-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\",\n    \"user\": {\n      \"name\": \"qa@example.com\",\n      \"type\": \"user\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"cloudName\": \"AzureCloud\",\n    \"id\": \"341751b0-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\",\n    \"isDefault\": false,\n    \"name\": \"Developer Team\",\n    \"state\": \"Enabled\",\n    \"tenantId\": \"ba85e8cd-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\",\n    \"user\": {\n      \"name\": \"dev@example.com\",\n      \"type\": \"user\"\n    }\n  }\n]\nChoose one of the subscriptions and make a note of its id - henceforth the subscription ID - and the tenantId.\nNext we need to create an application and a service principle, and grant permissions to the service principle. Use these commands:\n# Create an AAD application with your information.\naz ad app create --display-name  --password  --homepage  --identifier-uris \n\n# For example: az ad app create --display-name \"myappname\"  --password abcd --homepage \"https://myappwebsite\" --identifier-uris \"https://myappwebsite\"\nTake a note of the appId shown.\n# Create a Service Principal\naz ad sp create --id \nTake a note of the objectId shown - this will be the service principal object ID. (Note that any of the servicePrincipalNames can also be used in place of the object ID.)\n# Assign roles for this service principal. The \"principal\" can be the \"objectId\" or any one of the \"servicePrincipalNames\" from the previous step\naz role assignment create --assignee  --role Contributor --scope /subscriptions//\nBy this stage you should have the following information:\n\nA subscription ID\nA tenant ID\nAn application ID\nA service principle (either by its object ID, or by any one of its names)\n\nWe can now verify this information that this information can be used to log in to Azure:\naz login --service-principal -u  --password abcd --tenant \nAzure CLI 1.0\nFirstly, install and configure Azure CLI following these steps.\nUsing the Azure CLI, run the following commands to create a service principal\n# Set mode to ARM\nazure config mode arm\n\n# Enter your Microsoft account credentials when prompted\nazure login\n\n# Set current subscription to create a service principal\nazure account set \n\n# Create an AAD application with your information.\nazure ad app create --name  --password  --home-page  --identifier-uris \n\n# For example: azure ad app create --name \"myappname\"  --password abcd --home-page \"https://myappwebsite\" --identifier-uris \"https://myappwebsite\"\n\n# Output will include a value for `Application Id`, which will be used for the live tests\n\n# Create a Service Principal\nazure ad sp create --applicationId \n\n# Output will include a value for `Object Id`, to be used in the next step \nRun the following commands to assign roles to the service principal\n# Assign roles for this service principal\nazure role assignment create --objectId  -o Contributor -c /subscriptions//\nLook up the the tenant Id\nazure account show -s  --json\n\n# output will be a JSON which will include the `Tenant id`\nVerify service principal\nazure login -u  -p  --service-principal --tenant \nUsing the Azure ARM Location\nBelow is an example Azure ARM location in YAML which will launch a Ubuntu instance in south east asia:\nbrooklyn.catalog:\n  id: my-azure-arm-location\n  name: \"My Azure ARM location\"\n  itemType: location\n  item:\n    type: jclouds:azurecompute-arm\n    brooklyn.config:\n      identity: \n      credential: \n      endpoint: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/\n      oauth.endpoint: https://login.microsoftonline.com//oauth2/token\n\n      jclouds.azurecompute.arm.publishers: OpenLogic\n      region: southeastasia\n      loginUser: brooklyn\n      templateOptions:\n        overrideAuthenticateSudo: true \nFill the values , ,  and  in from the values generated when \nsetting up your credentials.

If jclouds is choosing the name for a resource (for example, a virtual machine), these properties will alter the way the resource is named.\n\nYou can add these options into the templateOptions element inside the brooklyn.config element in the example above:\n\nresourceGroup - select a Resource Group to deploy resources into. If not given, jclouds will generate a new resource group with a partly-random name.\n\nUsing Windows on Azure ARM\nThis section contains material how to create a Windows location on Azure ARM.

Apache Brooklyn includes support for both Azure Classic and Azure ARM, as\none of the Apache jclouds supported clouds Microsoft Azure Compute.\nThe two modes of using Azure are the \"classic deployment\" model and the newer \"Azure Resource Manager\" (ARM)\nmodel. See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/resource-manager-deployment-model/\nfor details.\nSetup the Azure credentials\nMicrosoft Azure requests are signed by SSL certificate. You need to upload one into your account in order to use an Azure\nlocation.\n# create the certificate request\nmkdir -m 700 $HOME/.brooklyn\nopenssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout $HOME/.brooklyn/azure.pem -out $HOME/.brooklyn/azure.pem\n# create the p12 file, and note your export password. This will be your test credentials.\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -out $HOME/.brooklyn/azure.p12 -in $HOME/.brooklyn/azure.pem -name \"brooklyn :: $USER\"\n# create a cer file\nopenssl x509 -inform pem -in $HOME/.brooklyn/azure.pem -outform der -out $HOME/.brooklyn/azure.cer\n\nFinally, upload .cer file to the management console at https://manage.windowsazure.com/@myId#Workspaces/AdminTasks/ListManagementCertificates to authorize this certificate.\nPlease note, you can find the \"myId\" value for this link by looking at the URL when logged into the Azure management portal.\nNote, you will need to use .p12 format in the brooklyn.properties.\nHow to configure Apache Brooklyn to use Azure Compute\nFirst, in your brooklyn.properties define a location as follows:\nbrooklyn.location.jclouds.azurecompute.identity=$HOME/.brooklyn/azure.p12\nbrooklyn.location.jclouds.azurecompute.credential=\nbrooklyn.location.jclouds.azurecompute.endpoint=https://management.core.windows.net/\nbrooklyn.location.jclouds.azurecompute.vmNameMaxLength=45\nbrooklyn.location.jclouds.azurecompute.jclouds.azurecompute.operation.timeout=120000\nbrooklyn.location.jclouds.azurecompute.user=\nbrooklyn.location.jclouds.azurecompute.password=\n\nDuring the VM provisioning, Azure will set up the account with  and  automatically.\nNotice,  must be a minimum of 8 characters and must contain 3 of the following: a lowercase character, an uppercase\ncharacter, a number, a special character.\nTo force Apache Brooklyn to use a particular image in Azure, say Ubuntu 14.04.1 64bit, one can add:\nbrooklyn.location.jclouds.azurecompute.imageId=b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-14_04_1-LTS-amd64-server-20150123-en-us-30GB\nFrom $BROOKLYN_HOME, you can list the image IDs available using the following command:\n./bin/client \"list-images --location azure-west-europe\"\nTo force Brooklyn to use a particular hardwareSpec in Azure, one can add something like:\nbrooklyn.location.jclouds.azurecompute.hardwareId=BASIC_A2\nFrom $BROOKLYN_HOME, you can list the hardware profile IDs available using the following command:\n./bin/client \"list-hardware-profiles --location azure-west-europe\"\nAt the time of writing, the classic deployment model has the possible values shown below.\nSee https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-size-specs/\nfor further details, though that description focuses on the new \"resource manager deployment\"\nrather than \"classic\".\n\nBasic_A0 to Basic_A4\nStandard_D1 to Standard_D4\nStandard_G1 to Standard_G5\nExtraSmall, Small, Medium, Large, ExtraLarge\n\nNamed location\nFor convenience, you can define a named location, like:\nbrooklyn.location.named.azure-west-europe=jclouds:azurecompute:West Europe\nbrooklyn.location.named.azure-west-europe.displayName=Azure West Europe\nbrooklyn.location.named.azure-west-europe.imageId=b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-14_04_1-LTS-amd64-server-20150123-en-us-30GB\nbrooklyn.location.named.azure-west-europe.hardwareId=BASIC_A2\nbrooklyn.location.named.azure-west-europe.user=test\nbrooklyn.location.named.azure-west-europe.password=MyPassword1!\n\nThis will create a location named azure-west-europe. It will inherit all the configuration\ndefined on brooklyn.location.jclouds.azurecompute. It will also augment and override this\nconfiguration (e.g. setting the display name, image id and hardware id).\nOn Linux VMs, The user and password will create a user with that name and set its password,\ndisabling the normal login user and password defined on the azurecompute location.\nWindows VMs on Azure\nThe following configuration options are important for provisioning Windows VMs in Azure:\n\nosFamily: windows tells Apache Brooklyn to consider it as a Windows machine\n\nuseJcloudsSshInit: false tells jclouds to not try to connect to the VM\n\nvmNameMaxLength: 15 tells the cloud client to strip the VM name to maximum 15 characters. \nThis is the maximum size supported by Azure Windows VMs.\n\nwinrm.useHttps tells Apache Brooklyn to configure the WinRM client to use HTTPS.\nThis is currently not supported in the default configuration for other clouds, where\nApache Brooklyn is deploying Windows VMs.\nIf the parameter value is false the default WinRM port is 5985; if true the default port \nfor WinRM will be 5986. Use of default ports is stongly recommended.\n\nwinrm.useNtlm tells Apache Brooklyn to configure the WinRM client to use NTLM protocol.\nFor Azure, this is mandatory.\nFor other clouds, this value is used in the cloud init script to configure WinRM on the VM.If the value is true then Basic Authentication will be disabled and the WinRM client will only use Negotiate plus NTLM.If the value is false then Basic Authentication will be enabled and the WinRM client will use Basic Authentication.\nNTLM is the default Authentication Protocol.\nThe format of this configuration option is subject to change: WinRM supports several \nauthentication mechanisms, so this may be changed to a prioritised list so as to\nprovide fallback options.\n\nuser tells Apache Brooklyn which user to login as. The value should match that supplied \nin the overrideLoginUser of the templateOptions.\n\npassword: tells Apache Brooklyn the password to use when connecting. The value should\nmatch that supplied in the overrideLoginPassword of the templateOptions.\n\ntemplateOptions: { overrideLoginUser: adminuser, overrideLoginPassword: Pa55w0rd! }tells the Azure Cloud to provision a VM with the given admin username and password. Note that\nno \"Administrator\" user will be created.\nIf this config is not set then the VM will have a default user named \"jclouds\" with password \n\"Azur3Compute!\". It is Strongly Recommended that these template options are set.\nNotice: one cannot use Administrator as the user in Azure.\nThis configuration is subject to change in future releases.\n\n\nSample Windows Blueprint\nBelow is an example for provisioning a Windows-based entity on Azure. Note the placeholder values \nfor the identity, credential and password.\nname: Windows Test @ Azure\nlocation:\n  jclouds:azurecompute:West Europe:\n    identity: /home/users/brooklyn/.brooklyn/azure.p12\n    credential: xxxxxxxp12\n    endpoint: https://management.core.windows.net/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc\n    imageId: 3a50f22b388a4ff7ab41029918570fa6__Windows-Server-2012-Essentials-20141204-enus\n    hardwareId: BASIC_A2\n    osFamily: windows\n    useJcloudsSshInit: false\n    vmNameMaxLength: 15\n    winrm.useHttps: true\n    user: brooklyn\n    password: secretPass1!\n    templateOptions:\n      overrideLoginUser: brooklyn\n      overrideLoginPassword: secretPass1!\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.VanillaWindowsProcess\n  brooklyn.config:\n    install.command: echo install phase\n    launch.command: echo launch phase\n    checkRunning.command: echo launch phase\n\nBelow is an example named location for Azure, configured in brooklyn.properties.

These values \ncorrespond to the options AdminUsername and AdminPassword in the Azure API.\nIf a hard-coded password is not desired, then within Java code a random password could be \nauto-generated and passed into the call to location.obtain(Map) to override these values.\nThis approach differs from the behaviour of clouds like AWS, where the password is auto-generated \nby the cloud provider and is then retrieved via the cloud provider's API after provisioning the VM.\nWinRM Configuration\nThe WinRM initialization in Azure is achieved through configuration options in the VM provisioning request.\nThe required configuration is to enabled HTTPS (if Azure is told to use http, the VM comes pre-configured \nwith WinRM encrypted over HTTP). The default is then to support NTLM protocol.\nThe setup of Windows VMs on Azure differs from that on other clouds, such as AWS. In contrast, on AWS an \ninit script is passed to the cloud API to configure WinRM appropriately.\nWindows initialization scripts in Azure are unfortunately not supported in \"classic deployment\"model, but are available in the newer \"resource manager deployment\" model as an \"Azure VM Extension\".\n\nsection: CloudStack\ntitle: Apache CloudStack\nsection_type: inline\nsection_position: 4\nApache CloudStack\nConnection Details\nThe endpoint URI will normally have the suffix /client/api/.\nThe identity is the \"api key\" and the credential is the \"secret key\". These can be generated in \nthe CloudStack gui: under accounts, select \"view users\", then \"generate key\".\nlocation:\n  jclouds:cloudstack:\n    endpoint: https://cloud.acme.com/client/api\n    identity: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890-abcdefghij\n    credential: mycred-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890-abc\nUsers are strongly recommended to use \nexternalized configuration for better\ncredential management, for example using Vault.\nCommon Configuration Options\nBelow are examples of configuration options that use values specific to CloudStack environments:\n\nThe imageId is the template id. For example,\nimageId: db0bcce3-9e9e-4a87-a953-2f46b603498f.\n\nThe region is CloudStack zone id.\nFor example region: 84539b9c-078e-458a-ae26-c3ffc5bb1ec9..\n\nnetworkName is the network id (within the given zone) to be used. For example, \nnetworkName: 961c03d4-9828-4037-9f4d-3dd597f60c4f.\n\n\nFor further configuration options, consult \njclouds CloudStack template options.\nThese can be used with the templateOptions configuration option.\nUsing a Pre-existing Key Pair\nThe configuration below uses a pre-existing key pair:\nlocation:\n  jclouds:cloudstack:\n    ...\n    loginUser: root\n    loginUser.privateKeyFile: /path/to/keypair.pem\n    keyPair: my-keypair\nUsing Pre-existing Security Groups\nTo specify existing security groups, their IDs must be used rather than their names (note this\ndiffers from the configuration on other clouds!).\nThe configuration below uses a pre-existing security group:\nlocation:\n  jclouds:cloudstack:\n    ...\n    templateOptions:\n      generateSecurityGroup: false\n      securityGroupIds:\n      - 12345678-90ab-def0-1234-567890abcdef\nUsing Static NAT\nAssigning a public IP to a VM at provision-time is referred to as \"static NAT\" in CloudStack\nparlance. To give some consistency across different clouds, the configuration option is named\nautoAssignFloatingIp. For example, autoAssignFloatingIp: false.\nCloudMonkey CLI\nThe CloudStack CloudMonkey CLI\nis a very useful tool. It gives is an easy way to validate that credentials are correct, and to querythe API to find the correct zone IDs etc.\nUseful commands include:\n# for finding the ids of the zones:\ncloudmonkey api listZones\n\n# for finding the ids of the networks.\ncloudmonkey api listNetworks | grep -E \"id =|name =|=========\"\nCloudStack Troubleshooting\nThese troubleshooting tips are more geared towards problems encountered in old test/dev \nCloudStack environment.\nResource Garbage Collection Issues\nThe environment may run out of resources, due to GC issues, preventing the user from creating new \nVMs or allocating IP addresses (May respond with this error message: \nerrorCode=INTERNAL_ERROR, errorText=Job failed due to exception Unable to create a deployment for VM). \nThere are two options worth checking it to enforce clearing up the zombie resources:\n\nGo to the Accounts tab in the webconsole and tap on the Update Resource Count button.\nRestart the VPC in question from the Network tab.\n\nReleasing Allocated Public IP Addresses\nReleasing an allocated Public IP from the web console did not free up the resources. Instead \nCloudMonkey can be used to dissociate IPs and expunge VMs.\nHere is a CloudMonkey script to dissociate any zombie IPs:\ncloudmonkey set display json;\ncloudmonkey api listPublicIpAddresses | grep '\"id\":' > ips.txt; \nsed -i -e s/'      \"id\": \"'/''/g ips.txt;\nsed -i -e s/'\",'/''/g ips.txt\nfor line in $(cat ips.txt); do cloudmonkey api disassociateIpAddress id=\"$line\"; done\nrm ips.txt;\ncloudmonkey set display default;\nRestarting VPCs\nErrors have been encountered when a zone failed to provision new VMs, with messages like:\nJob failed due to exception Resource [Host:15] is unreachable: Host 15: Unable to start instance due to null\nThe workaround was to restart the VPC networks:\n\nLog into the CloudStack web-console.\nGo to Network -> VPC (from the \"select view\")\nFor each of the VPCs, click on the \"+\" in the \"quickview\" column, and invoke \"restart VPC\".\n\nOther symptoms of this issue were that: 1) an administrator could still provision VMs using \nthe admin account, which used a different network; and 2) the host number was very low, so it \nwas likely to be a system host/VM that was faulty.\n\nsection: Google Compute Engine (GCE)\ntitle: Google Compute Engine\nsection_type: inline\nsection_position: 5\nGoogle Compute Engine (GCE)\nCredentials\nGCE uses a service account e-mail address for the identity and a private key as the credential.\nTo obtain credentials for GCE, use the GCE web page's \"APIs & auth -> Credentials\" page,\ncreating a \"Service Account\" of type JSON, then extracting the client_email as the identity and \nprivate_key as the credential. For more information, see the \njclouds instructions.\nAn example of the expected format is shown below. Note that when supplying the credential in a \nproperties file, it can either be one long line with \\n representing the new line characters, \nor in YAML it can be split over multiple lines as below:\nlocation:\n  jclouds:google-compute-engine:\n    region: us-central1-a\n    identity: 1234567890-somet1mesArand0mU1Dhere@developer.gserviceaccount.com\n    credential: |\n      -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n      abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n      0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmn\n      opqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+ab\n      cdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01\n      23456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnop\n      qrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcd\n      efghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123\n      456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqr\n      stuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdef\n      ghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345\n      6789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrst\n      uvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefgh\n      ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567\n      89/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv\n      wxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghij\n      klmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789\n      /+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\n      yz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijkl\n      mnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+\n      abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n      0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmn\n      opqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+ab\n      cdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n      -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nIt is also possible to have the credential be the path of a local file that contains the key.\nHowever, this can make it harder to setup and manage multiple Brooklyn servers (particularly\nwhen using high availability mode).\nUsers are strongly recommended to use \nexternalized configuration for better\ncredential management, for example using Vault.\nQuotas\nGCE accounts can have low default quotas.\nIt is easy to request a quota increase by submitting a quota increase form.\nNetworks\nGCE accounts often have a limit to the number of networks that can be created. One work around\nis to manually create a network with the required open ports, and to refer to that named network\nin Brooklyn's location configuration.\nTo create a network, see GCE network instructions.\nFor example, for dev/demo purposes an \"everything\" network could be created that opens all ports.\n|| Name                        || everything                  |\n|| Description                 || opens all tcp ports         |\n|| Source IP Ranges            || 0.0.0.0/0                   |\n|| Allowed protocols and ports || tcp:0-65535 and udp:0-65535 |\nTo configure the location to use this, you can include a location configuration option like:\ntemplateOptions:\n  network: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects//global/networks/everything\n\nsection: IBM Softlayer\ntitle: IBM Softlayer\nsection_type: inline\nsection_position: 6\nIBM SoftLayer\nCredentials\nCredentials can be obtained from the Softlayer API, under \"administrative -> user administration -> api-access\".\nFor example:\nlocation:\n  jclouds:softlayer:\n    region: ams01\n    identity: my-user-name\n    credential: 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef\nUsers are strongly recommended to use \nexternalized configuration for better\ncredential management, for example using Vault.\nCommon Configuration Options\nBelow are examples of configuration options that use values specific to Softlayer:\n\nThe region is the Softlayer datacenter.\nFor example, region: dal05.\n\nThe hardwareId is an auto-generated combination of the hardware configuration options.\nThis is because there is no concept of hardwareId or hardware profile names in Softlayer. \nAn example value is hardwareId: \"cpu=1,memory=1024,disk=25,type=LOCAL\".\n\nThe imageId is the Image template.\nFor example, imageId: CENTOS_6_64.\n\n\nVLAN Selection\nSoftLayer may provision VMs in different VLANs, even within the same region.\nSome applications require VMs to be on the same internal subnet; blueprints\nfor these can specify this behaviour in SoftLayer in one of two ways.\nThe VLAN ID can be set explicitly using the fields\nprimaryNetworkComponentNetworkVlanId and\nprimaryBackendNetworkComponentNetworkVlanId of SoftLayerTemplateOptions\nwhen specifying the location being used in the blueprint, as follows:\nlocation:\n  jclouds:softlayer:\n    region: ams01\n    templateOptions:\n      # Enter your preferred network IDs\n      primaryNetworkComponentNetworkVlanId: 1153481\n      primaryBackendNetworkComponentNetworkVlanId: 1153483\nThis method requires that a VM already exist and you look up the IDs of its\nVLANs, for example in the SoftLayer console UI, and that subsequently at least\none VM in that VLAN is kept around.  If all VMs on a VLAN are destroyed\nSoftLayer may destroy the VLAN.  Creating VLANs directly and then specifying\nthem as IDs here may not work.  Add a line note\nThe second method tells Brooklyn to discover VLAN information automatically: it\nwill provision one VM first, and use the VLAN information from it when\nprovisioning subsequent machines. This ensures that all VMs are on the same\nsubnet without requiring any manual VLAN referencing, making it very easy for\nend-users.\nTo use this method, we tell brooklyn to use SoftLayerSameVlanLocationCustomizer\nas a location customizer.  This can be done on a location as follows:\nlocation:\n  jclouds:softlayer:\n    region: lon02\n    customizers:\n    - $brooklyn:object:\n        type: org.apache.brooklyn.location.jclouds.softlayer.SoftLayerSameVlanLocationCustomizer\n    softlayer.vlan.scopeUid: \"my-custom-scope\"\n    softlayer.vlan.timeout: 10m\nUsually you will want the scope to be unique to a single application, but if you\nneed multiple applications to share the same VLAN, simply configure them with\nthe same scope identifier.\nIt is also possible with many blueprints to specify this as one of the\nprovisioning.properties on an application:\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.stock.BasicApplication\n  id: same-vlan-application\n  brooklyn.config:\n    provisioning.properties:\n      customizers:\n      - $brooklyn:object:\n          type: org.apache.brooklyn.location.jclouds.softlayer.SoftLayerSameVlanLocationCustomizer\n    softlayer.vlan.scopeUid: \"my-custom-scope\"\n    softlayer.vlan.timeout: 10m\nIf you are writing an entity in Java, you can also use the helper\nmethod forScope(String) to create the customizer. Configure the\nprovisioning flags as follows:\nJcloudsLocationCustomizer vlans = SoftLayerSameVlanLocationCustomizer.forScope(\"my-custom-scope\");\nflags.put(JcloudsLocationConfig.JCLOUDS_LOCATION_CUSTOMIZERS.getName(), ImmutableList.of(vlans));\nConfiguration Options\nThe allowed configuration keys for the SoftLayerSameVlanLocationCustomizer\nare:\n\nsoftlayer.vlan.scopeUid The scope identifier for locations whose\nVMs will have the same VLAN.\n\nsoftlayer.vlan.timeout The amount of time to wait for a VM to\nbe configured before timing out without setting the VLAN ids.\n\nsoftlayer.vlan.publicId A specific public VLAN ID to use for\nthe specified scope.\n\nsoftlayer.vlan.privateId A specific private VLAN ID to use for\nthe specified scope.\n\n\nAn entity being deployed to a customized location will have the VLAN ids set as\nsensors, with the same names as the last two configuration keys.\nNOTE If the SoftLayer location is already configured with specific VLANs\nthen this customizer will have no effect.\n\nsection: OpenStack\ntitle: OpenStack\nsection_type: inline\nsection_position: 7\nOpenStack\nApache jclouds\nSupport for OpenStack is provided by Apache jclouds. For more information, see their guide\nhere.\nConnection Details\nThe endpoint URI is that of keystone (normally on port 5000).\nThe identity normally consists of a colon-separated tenant and username. The credential is \nthe password. For example:\nlocation:\n  jclouds:openstack-nova:\n    endpoint: http://x.x.x.x:5000/v2.0/\n    identity: \"your-tenant:your-username\"\n    credential: your-password\nOpenStack Nova access information can be downloaded from the openstack web interface, for example \nas an openrc.sh file. It is usually available from API Access tab in \"Access & Security\" section.\nThis file will normally contain the identity and credential.\nUsers are strongly recommended to use \nexternalized configuration for better\ncredential management, for example using Vault.\nCommon Configuration Options\nBelow are examples of configuration options that use values specific to OpenStack environments:\n\nThe imageId is the id of an image. For example,\nimageId: RegionOne/08086159-8b0b-4970-b332-a7a929ee601f.\nThese ids can be found from the the CLI or the web-console, for example in IBM Blue Box London, \nthe URL is https://tenant-region.openstack.blueboxgrid.com/project/images/.\n\nThe hardwareId is the flavor id.\nFor example hardwareId: RegionOne/1. These ids can be found from the the CLI or the web-console,\nfor example in IBM Blue Box, the URL is https://tenant-region.openstack.blueboxgrid.com/admin/flavors/.\n\n\nThe default flavors are shown below (though the set of flavors can be \nmanaged by the admin):\n+-----+-----------+-----------+------+\n| ID  | Name      | Memory_MB | Disk |\n+-----+-----------+-----------+------+\n| 1   | m1.tiny   | 512       | 1    |\n| 2   | m1.small  | 2048      | 20   |\n| 3   | m1.medium | 4096      | 40   |\n| 4   | m1.large  | 8192      | 80   |\n| 5   | m1.xlarge | 16384     | 160  |\n+-----+-----------+-----------+------+\nFor further configuration options, consult \njclouds Nova template options.\nThese can be used with the templateOptions configuration option.\nNetworks\nWhen multiple networks are available you should indicate which ones machines should join.\nDo this by setting the desired values id as an option in the\ntemplateOptions configuration:\nlocation:\n  jclouds:openstack-nova:\n    ...\n    templateOptions:\n      # Assign the node to all networks in the list.\n      networks:\n      - network-one-id\n      - network-two-id\n      - ...\nFloating IPs\nThe autoAssignFloatingIp option means that a floating ip\nwill be assigned to the VM at provision-time.\nA floating IP pool name can also be specified. If not set, a floating IP from any available pool will be chosen.\nThis is set using the template option. For example:\nlocation:\n  jclouds:openstack-nova:\n    ...\n    autoAssignFloatingIp: true\n    templateOptions:\n      # Pool names to use when allocating a floating IP\n      floatingIpPoolNames:\n      - \"pool name\"\nBasic Location Structure\nThis is a basic inline YAML template for an OpenStack location:\nlocation:\n    jclouds:openstack-nova:\n        endpoint: http://x.x.x.x:5000/v2.0/\n        identity: \"your-tenant:your-username\"\n        credential: your-password\n\n        # imageId, hardwareId, and loginUser* are optional\n        imageId: your-region-name/your-image-id\n        hardwareId: your-region-name/your-flavor-id\n        loginUser: 'ubuntu'\n        loginUser.privateKeyFile: /path/to/your/privatekey\n\n        jclouds.openstack-nova.auto-generate-keypairs: false\n        jclouds.openstack-nova.auto-create-floating-ips: true\n\n        templateOptions:\n            networks: [ \"your-network-id\" ]\n            floatingIpPoolNames: [ \"your-floatingIp-pool\" ]\n            securityGroups: ['your-security-group']\n\n            # Optional if 'jclouds.openstack-nova.auto-generate-keypairs' is assigned to 'true'\n            keyPairName: \"your-keypair\"\nThis is the same OpenStack location in a format that can be added to your\nbrooklyn.properties file:\nbrooklyn.location.named.My\\ OpenStack=jclouds:openstack-nova:http://x.x.x.x:5000/v2.0/\nbrooklyn.location.named.My\\ OpenStack.identity=your-tenant:your-username\nbrooklyn.location.named.My\\ OpenStack.credential=your-password\nbrooklyn.location.named.My\\ OpenStack.endpoint=http://x.x.x.x:5000/v2.0/\n\nbrooklyn.location.named.My\\ OpenStack.imageId=your-region-name/your-image-id\nbrooklyn.location.named.My\\ OpenStack.hardwareId=your-region-name/your-flavor-id\nbrooklyn.location.named.My\\ OpenStack.loginUser=ubuntu\nbrooklyn.location.named.My\\ OpenStack.loginUser.privateKeyFile=/path/to/your/privatekey\nbrooklyn.location.named.My\\ OpenStack.openstack-nova.auto-generate-keypairs=false\nbrooklyn.location.named.My\\ OpenStack.openstack-nova.auto-create-floating-ips=true\n\nbrooklyn.location.named.My\\ OpenStack.networks=your-network-id\nbrooklyn.location.named.My\\ OpenStack.floatingIpPoolNames=your-floatingIp-pool\nbrooklyn.location.named.My\\ OpenStack.securityGroups=your-security-group\nbrooklyn.location.named.My\\ OpenStack.keyPair=your-keypair\nTroubleshooting\nCloud Credentials Failing\nIf the cloud API calls return 401 Unauthorized (e.g. in a org.jclouds.rest.AuthorizationException),\nthen this could be because the credentials are incorrect.\nA good way to check this is to try the same credentials with the \nOpenStack nova command line client.\nUnable to SSH: Wrong User\nIf SSH authentication fails, it could be that the login user is incorrect. For most clouds, this \nis inferred from the image metadata, but if no (or the wrong) login user is specified then it willdefault to root. The correct login user can be specified using the configuration option loginUser.\nFor example, loginUser: ubuntu.\nThe use of the wrong login user can also result in the obscure message, caused by \nan unexpected response saying to use a different user. For more technical information, see \nthis sshj github issue. The message is:\nReceived message too long 1349281121\nI Want to Use My Own KeyPair\nBy default, jclouds will auto-generate a new key pair\nfor the VM. This key pair will be deleted automatically when the VM is deleted.\nAlternatively, you can use a pre-existing key pair. If so, you must also specify the corresponding\nprivate key (pem file, or data) to be used for the initial login. The name used in the keyPair \nconfiguration must match the name of a key pair that has already been added in OpenStack.\nFor example:\nlocation:\n  jclouds:clouds:openstack-nova:\n    ...\n    jclouds.openstack-nova.auto-generate-keypairs: false\n    keyPair: \"my-keypair\"\n    loginUser: ubuntu\n    loginUser.privateKeyFile: /path/to/my/privatekey.pem\nError \"doesn't contain ... -----BEGIN\"\nIf using loginUser.privateKeyFile (or loginUser.privateKeyData), this is expected to be a .pem\nfile. If a different format is used (e.g. a .ppk file), it will give an error like that below:\nError invoking start at EmptySoftwareProcessImpl{id=TrmhitVc}: chars\nPuTTY-User-Key-File-2: ssh-rsa\n...\ndoesn't contain % line [-----BEGIN ]\nWarning Message: \"Ignoring request to set...\"\nIf you see a warning log message like that below:\n2016-06-23 06:05:12,297 WARN  o.a.b.l.j.JcloudsLocation [brooklyn-execmanager-XlwkWB3k-312]: \nIgnoring request to set template option loginUser because this is not supported by \norg.jclouds.openstack.nova.v2_0.compute.options.NovaTemplateOptions\nIt can mean that the location configuration option is in the wrong place. The configuration under \ntemplateOptions must correspond to those options on the\njclouds Nova template options.\nHowever, template options such as loginUser are top-level configuration options that should not\nbe inside the templateOptions section.\nHttpResponseException Accessing Compute Endpoint\nThe Keystone endpoint is first queried to get the API access endpoints for the appropriate services.\nSome private OpenStack installs are (mis)configured such that the returned addresses are not always \ndirectly accessible. It could be that the service is behind a VPN, or that they rely on hostnames\nthat are only in a private DNS.\nYou can find the service endpoints in OpenStack, either using the CLI or the web-console. For \nexample, in Blue Box the URL is https://tenant-region.openstack.blueboxgrid.com/project/access_and_security/.\nYou can then check if the Compute service endpoint is directly reachable.\nVM Failing to Provision\nIt can be useful to drop down to the OpenStack nova CLI, or to jclouds, to confirm that VM\nprovisioning is working and to check which options are required.\nFor example, try following these jclouds instructions.\njclouds Namespace Issue\nA change to Nova's API (in the Mitaka release) resulted in all extensions having the same \"fake\" \nnamespace which the current version of jclouds does not yet support.\nIf you are having problems deploying to OpenStack, consult your Brooklyn debug log and\nlook for the following:\n\"namespace\": \"http://docs.openstack.org/compute/ext/fake_xml\"\nIf you already have jclouds:openstack-mitaka-nova, then try using this instead of the vanilla\njclouds:openstack-nova. For example:\nlocation:\n    jclouds:openstack-mitaka-nova:\n        endpoint: http://x.x.x.x:5000/v2.0/\n        identity: \"your-tenant:your-username\"\n        credential: your-password\n        templateOptions:\n            networks: [ \"your-network-id\" ]\n            floatingIpPoolNames: [ \"your-floatingIp-pool\" ]\nNote that the following values will be set by default when omitted above:\njclouds.keystone.credential-type=passwordCredentials\njclouds.openstack-nova.auto-generate-keypairs: true\njclouds.openstack-nova.auto-create-floating-ips: true\n\nsection: Inheritance and Named Locations\ntitle: Named Locations\nsection_type: inline\nsection_position: 7\nInheritance and Named Locations\nNamed locations can be defined for commonly used groups of properties, \nwith the syntax brooklyn.location.named.your-group-name.\nfollowed by the relevant properties.\nThese can be accessed at runtime using the syntax named:your-group-name as the deployment location.\nSome illustrative examples using named locations and\nshowing the syntax and properties above are as follows:\n# Production pool of machines for my application (deploy to named:prod1)\nbrooklyn.location.named.prod1=byon:(hosts=\"10.9.1.1,10.9.1.2,produser2@10.9.2.{10,11,20-29}\")\nbrooklyn.location.named.prod1.user=produser1\nbrooklyn.location.named.prod1.privateKeyFile=~/.ssh/produser_id_rsa\nbrooklyn.location.named.prod1.privateKeyPassphrase=s3cr3tCOMPANYpassphrase\n\n# AWS using my company's credentials and image standard, then labelling images so others know they're mine\nbrooklyn.location.named.company-jungle=jclouds:aws-ec2:us-west-1\nbrooklyn.location.named.company-jungle.identity=BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU  \nbrooklyn.location.named.company-jungle.privateKeyFile=~/.ssh/public_clouds/company_aws_id_rsa\nbrooklyn.location.named.company-jungle.imageId=ami-12345\nbrooklyn.location.named.company-jungle.minRam=2048\nbrooklyn.location.named.company-jungle.userMetadata=application=my-jungle-app,owner=\"Bob Johnson\"\nbrooklyn.location.named.company-jungle.machineCreateAttempts=2\n\nbrooklyn.location.named.AWS\\ Virginia\\ Large\\ Centos = jclouds:aws-ec2\nbrooklyn.location.named.AWS\\ Virginia\\ Large\\ Centos.region = us-east-1\nbrooklyn.location.named.AWS\\ Virginia\\ Large\\ Centos.imageId=us-east-1/ami-7d7bfc14\nbrooklyn.location.named.AWS\\ Virginia\\ Large\\ Centos.user=root\nbrooklyn.location.named.AWS\\ Virginia\\ Large\\ Centos.minRam=4096\n\nNamed locations can refer to other named locations using named:xxx as their value.\nThese will inherit the configuration and can override selected keys.\nProperties set in the namespace of the provider (e.g. b.l.jclouds.aws-ec2.KEY=VALUE)\nwill be inherited by everything which extends AWS\nSub-prefix strings are also inherited up to brooklyn.location.*, \nexcept that they are filtered for single-word and other\nknown keys \n(so that we exclude provider-scoped properties when looking at sub-prefix keys).\nThe precedence for configuration defined at different levels is that the value\ndefined in the most specific context will apply.\nThis is rather straightforward and powerful to use,\nalthough it sounds rather more complicated than it is!\nThe examples below should make it clear.\nYou could use the following to install\na public key on all provisioned machines,\nan additional public key in all AWS machines, \nand no extra public key in prod1: \n\nbrooklyn.location.extraSshPublicKeyUrls=http://me.com/public_key\nbrooklyn.location.jclouds.aws-ec2.extraSshPublicKeyUrls=\"[ \\\"http://me.com/public_key\\\", \\\"http://me.com/aws_public_key\\\" ]\"\nbrooklyn.location.named.prod1.extraSshPublicKeyUrls=\n\nAnd in the example below, a config key is repeatedly overridden. \nDeploying location: named:my-extended-aws will result in an aws-ec2 machine in us-west-1 (by inheritance)\nwith VAL6 for KEY:\nbrooklyn.location.KEY=VAL1\nbrooklyn.location.jclouds.KEY=VAL2\nbrooklyn.location.jclouds.aws-ec2.KEY=VAL3\nbrooklyn.location.jclouds.aws-ec2@us-west-1.KEY=VAL4\nbrooklyn.location.named.my-aws=jclouds:aws-ec2:us-west-1\nbrooklyn.location.named.my-aws.KEY=VAL5\nbrooklyn.location.named.my-extended-aws=named:my-aws\nbrooklyn.location.named.my-extended-aws.KEY=VAL6\n\n\nsection: BYON\nsection_position: 8\nsection_type: inline\nBYON\n\"Bring-your-own-nodes\" mode is useful in production, where machines have been provisioned by someone else,\nand during testing, to cut down provisioning time.\nYour nodes must meet the following prerequisites:\n\nA suitable OS must have been installed on all nodes\nThe node must be running sshd (or similar)\nthe brooklyn user must be able to ssh to each node as root or as a user with passwordless sudo permission. (For more information on SSH keys, see here.) \n\nTo deploy to machines with known IP's in a blueprint, use the following syntax:\nlocation:\n  byon:\n    user: brooklyn\n    privateKeyFile: ~/.ssh/brooklyn.pem\n    hosts:\n    - 192.168.0.18\n    - 192.168.0.19\n\nSome of the login properties as described above for jclouds are supported,\nbut not loginUser (as no users are created), and not any of the\nVM creation parameters such as minRam and imageId.\n(These clearly do not apply in the same way, and they are not \nby default treated as constraints, although an entity can confirm these\nwhere needed.)\nAs before, if the brooklyn user and its default key are authorized for the hosts,\nthose fields can be omitted.\nNamed locations can also be configured in your brooklyn.properties,\nusing the format byon:(key=value,key2=value2).\nFor convenience, for hosts wildcard globs are supported.\nbrooklyn.location.named.On-Prem\\ Iron\\ Example=byon:(hosts=\"10.9.1.1,10.9.1.2,produser2@10.9.2.{10,11,20-29}\")\nbrooklyn.location.named.On-Prem\\ Iron\\ Example.user=produser1\nbrooklyn.location.named.On-Prem\\ Iron\\ Example.privateKeyFile=~/.ssh/produser_id_rsa\nbrooklyn.location.named.On-Prem\\ Iron\\ Example.privateKeyPassphrase=s3cr3tpassphrase\n\nAlternatively, you can create a specific BYON location through the location wizard tool available within the web console.\nThis location will be saved as a catalog entry for easy reusability.\nFor more complex host configuration, one can define custom config values per machine. In the example \nbelow, there will be two machines. The first will be a machine reachable on\nssh -i ~/.ssh/brooklyn.pem -p 8022 myuser@50.51.52.53. The second is a windows machine, reachable \nover WinRM. Each machine has also has a private address (e.g. for within a private network).\nlocation:\n  byon:\n    hosts:\n    - ssh: 50.51.52.53:8022\n      privateAddresses: [10.0.0.1]\n      privateKeyFile: ~/.ssh/brooklyn.pem\n      user: myuser\n    - winrm: 50.51.52.54:8985\n      privateAddresses: [10.0.0.2]\n      password: mypassword\n      user: myuser\n      osFamily: windows\n\nThe BYON location also supports a machine chooser, using the config key byon.machineChooser. \nThis allows one to plugin logic to choose from the set of available machines in the pool. For\nexample, additional config could be supplied for each machine. This could be used (during the call\nto location.obtain()) to find the config that matches the requirements of the entity being\nprovisioned. See FixedListMachineProvisioningLocation.MACHINE_CHOOSER.\nsection: SSH Keys\nsection_position: 9\nsection_type: inline\nSSH Keys\nSSH keys are one of the simplest and most secure ways to access remote servers.\nThey consist of two parts:\n\nA private key (e.g. id_rsa) which is known only to one party or group\n\nA public key (e.g. id_rsa.pub) which can be given to anyone and everyone,\nand which can be used to confirm that a party has a private key\n(or has signed a communication with the private key)\n\n\nIn this way, someone -- such as you -- can have a private key,\nand can install a public key on a remote machine (in an authorized_keys file)\nfor secure automated access.\nCommands such as ssh (and Brooklyn) can log in without\nrevealing the private key to the remote machine,\nthe remote machine can confirm it is you accessing it (if no one else has the private key),\nand no one snooping on the network can decrypt of any of the traffic.\nCreating an SSH Key\nIf you don't have an SSH key, create one with:\n$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -N \"\" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nLocalhost Setup\nIf you want to deploy to localhost, ensure that you have a public and private key,\nand that your key is authorized for ssh access:\n# _Appends_ id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys. Other keys are unaffected.\n$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nNow verify that your setup by running the command: ssh localhost echo hello world\nIf your setup is correct, you should see hello world printed back at you.\nOn the first connection, you may see a message similar to this:\n\nThe authenticity of host 'localhost (::1)' can't be established.\nRSA key fingerprint is 7b:e3:8e:c6:5b:2a:05:a1:7c:8a:cf:d1:6a:83:c2:ad.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\n\n\nSimply answer 'yes' and then repeat the command again.\nIf this isn't the case, see below. \nPotential Problems\n\nMacOS user? In addition to the above, enable \"Remote Login\" in \"System Preferences > Sharing\".\n\nGot a passphrase? Set brooklyn.location.localhost.privateKeyPassphrase\nas described here.\nIf you're not sure, or you don't know what a passphrase is, you can test this by executing ssh-keygen -y.\nIf it does not ask for a passphrase, then your key has no passphrase.\nIf your key does have a passphrase, you can remove it by running ssh-keygen -p.\n\nCheck that you have an ~/.ssh/id_rsa file (or id_dsa) and a corresponding public key with a .pub extension;\nif not, create one as described above\n\n~/.ssh/ or files in that directory may have permissions they shouldn't: \nthey should be visible only to the user (apart from public keys),\nboth on the source machine and the target machine.\nYou can verify this with ls -l ~/.ssh/:  lines should start with -rw------- or -r-------- (or -rwx------ for directories). \nIf it does not, execute chmod go-rwx ~/.ssh ~/.ssh/*.\n\nSometimes machines are configured with different sets of support SSL/TLS versions and ciphers;\nif command-line ssh and scp work, but Brooklyn/java does not, check the versions enabled in Java and on both servers.\n\nMissing entropy: creating and using ssh keys requires randomness available on the servers,\nusually in /dev/random; see here for more information\n\n\n\nsection: Localhost\nsection_position: 10\nsection_type: inline\nLocalhost\nIf passwordless ssh login to localhost and passwordless sudo is enabled on your \nmachine, you should be able to deploy some blueprints with no special configuration,\njust by specifying location: localhost in YAML.\nIf you use a passphrase or prefer a different key, these can be configured as follows:\nlocation:\n  localhost:\n    privateKeyFile=~/.ssh/brooklyn_key\n    privateKeyPassphrase=s3cr3tPASSPHRASE\nAlternatively, you can create a specific localhost location through the location wizard tool available within the web console.\nThis location will be saved as a catalog entry \nfor easy reusability.\nPasswordless Sudo\nIf you encounter issues or for more information, see SSH Keys Localhost Setup. \nFor some blueprints, passwordless sudo is required. (Try executing sudo whoami to see if it prompts for a password. \nTo enable passwordless sudo for your account, a line must be added to the system /etc/sudoers file.To edit the file, use the visudo command:\nsudo visudo\n\nAdd this line at the bottom of the file, replacing username with your own user:\nusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nIf executing the following command does not ask for your password, then sudo has been setup correctly:\nsudo whoami\n\n\nsection: Location Customizers\nsection_type: inline\nsection_position: 11\nLocation Customizers\nApache Brooklyn supports a number of ways to configure and customize locations. These include\nthe JcloudsLocationCustomizer, which is for advanced customization of VM provisioning through jclouds.\nThere is also a MachineLocationCustomizer, which allows customization of machines being obtained \nfrom any kind of location (including Bring Your Own Nodes).\nUsage Guidelines\nClearly there is an overlap for where things can be done. This section describes the recommendedseparation of responsibilities.\nThese are guidelines only - users are obviously free to make alternative usage decisions based on \ntheir particular use-cases.\nResponsibilities of Entity versus Location\nFrom an entity's perspective, it calls location.obtain(options) and gets back a usable \nMachineLocation that has a standard base operating system that gives remote access\n(e.g. for Linux it expects credentials for a user with sudo rights, and ssh access).\nHowever, there are special cases - for example the location.obtain(options) could return\na Docker container with the software pre-installed, and no remote access (see the \nClocker project for more information on use of Docker with Brooklyn).\nThe entity is then responsible for configuring that machine according to the needs of the software \nto be installed.\nFor example, the entity may install software packages, upload/update configuration files, launch\nprocesses, etc.\nThe entity may also configure iptables. This is also possible through the JcloudsLocation \nconfiguration. However, it is preferable to do this in the entity because it is part of \nconfiguring the machine in the way required for the given software component.\nThe entity may also perform custom OS setup, such as installing security patches. However, whether \nthis is appropriate depends on the nature of the security patch: if the security patch is specific \nto the entity type, then it should be done within the entity; but if it is to harden the base OS \nto make it comply with an organisation's standards (e.g. to overcome shortcomings of the base \nimage, or to install security patches) then a MachineLocationCustomizer is more appropriate.\nLocation Configuration Options\nThis refers to standard location configuration: explicit config keys, and explicit jclouds template \nconfiguration that can be passed through.\nThis kind of configuration is simplest to use. It is the favoured mechanism when it comes to VM \nprovisioning, and should be used wherever possible.\nNote that a jclouds TemplateBuilder and cloud-specific TemplateOptions are the generic mechanisms \nwithin jclouds for specifying the details of the compute resource to be provisioned.\nJclouds Location Customizer\nA JcloudsLocationCustomizer has customization hooks to execute code at the various points of building \nup the jclouds template and provisioning the machine. Where jclouds is being used and where the required \nuse of jclouds goes beyond simple configuration, this is an appropriate solution.\nFor example, there is a org.apache.brooklyn.location.jclouds.networking.JcloudsLocationSecurityGroupCustomizer\nwhich gives more advanced support for setting up security groups (e.g. in AWS-EC2).\nMachine Customizer\nThe MachineLocationCustomizer allows customization of machines being obtained from any kind of location.\nFor example, this includes for jclouds and for Bring Your Own Nodes (BYON).\nIt provides customization hooks for when the machine has been provisioned (before it is returned by the location)\nand when the machine is about to be released by the location.\nAn example use would be to register (and de-register) the machine in a CMDB.\nJclouds Location Customizers\nWarning: additional methods (i.e. customization hooks) may be added to the JcloudsLocationCustomizer \ninterface in future releases. Users are therefore strongly encouraged to sub-class \nBasicJcloudsLocationCustomizer, rather than implementing JcloudsLocationCustomizer directly.\nThe JcloudsLocationCustomizer provides customization hooks at various points of the Brooklyn's\nuse of jclouds. These can be used to adjust the configuration, to do additional setup, to do\ncustom logging, etc.\n\nCustomize the org.jclouds.compute.domain.TemplateBuilder, before it is used to build the template.\nThis is used to influence the choice of VM image, hardware profile, etc. This hook is not normally\nrequired as the location configuration options can be used in instead.\n\nCustomize the org.jclouds.compute.domain.Template, to be used when creating the machine. Thishook is most often used for performing custom actions - for example to create or modify a security \ngroup or volume, and to update the template's options to use that.\n\nCustomize the org.jclouds.compute.options.TemplateOptions to be used when creating the machine.\nThe TemplateOptions could be cast to a cloud-specific sub-type (if this does not have to work\nacross different clouds). Where the use-case is to just set simple configuration on the \nTemplateOptions, consider instead using the config key templateOptions, which takes a map\nof type String to Object - the strings should match the method names in the TemplateOptions.\n\nCustomize the org.apache.brooklyn.location.jclouds.JcloudsMachineLocation that has been \ncreated. For Linux-based VMs, if the config waitForSshable was not false, then this machine\nis guaranteed to be ssh'able. Similarly for WinRM access to Windows machines, if \nwaitForWinRmAvailable was not false.\n\nPre-release of the machine. If the actions required are specific to jclouds (e.g. using jclouds \nto make calls to the cloud provider) then this should be used; otherwise one should use the more\ngeneric MachineLocationCustomizer.\n\nPost-release of the machine (i.e. after asking jclouds to destroying the machine).\n\n\nTo register a JcloudsLocationCustomizer in YAML, the config key customizers can be used to \nprovide a list of instances. Each instance can be defined using $brooklyn:object to indicate \nthe type and its configuration. For example:\nlocation:\n  jclouds:aws-ec2:us-east-1:\n    customizers:\n    - $brooklyn:object:\n        type: com.acme.brooklyn.MyJcloudsLocationCustomizer\nTo register JcloudsLocationCustomizer instances programmatically, set the config key\nJcloudsLocationConfig.JCLOUDS_LOCATION_CUSTOMIZERS on the location, or pass this \nconfig option when calling location.obtain(options).\nThe SharedLocationSecurityGroupCustomizer configures a shared security group on Jclouds locations.\nIt only works on AWS and Azure ARM.\nTo register a SharedLocationSecurityGroupCustomizer in YAML, you can use the config key customizers\nand configure it with $brooklyn:object and object.fields. For example:\nlocation:\n  jclouds:aws-ec2:us-east-1:\n    customizers:\n    - $brooklyn:object:\n        type: org.apache.brooklyn.location.jclouds.networking.SharedLocationSecurityGroupCustomizer\n        object.fields: {locationName: \"myloc\", tcpPortRanges: [\"22\", \"8080\", \"9443\"], udpPortRanges: [\"2001\", \"4013\"], cidr: \"82.40.153.101/24\"}\nwhere cidr can be optionally set to restrict the range that the ports that are to be opened can be accessed from.\nMachine Location Customizers\nWarning: additional methods (i.e. customization hooks) may be added to the MachineLocationCustomizer \ninterface in future releases. Users are therefore strongly encouraged to sub-class \nBasicMachineLocationCustomizer, rather than implementing MachineLocationCustomizer directly.\nThe MachineLocationCustomizer provides customization hooks for when a machine is obtained/released \nfrom a MachineProvisioningLocation. The following hooks are supported: \n\nAfter the machine has been provisioned/allocated, but before it has been returned.\n\nWhen the machine is about to be released, but prior to actually destroying/unallocating the\nmachine.\n\n\nTo register a MachineLocationCustomizer in YAML, the config key machineCustomizers can be usedto provide a list of instances. Each instance can be defined using $brooklyn:object to indicate \nthe type and its configuration. For example:\nlocation:\n  jclouds:aws-ec2:us-east-1:\n    machineCustomizers:\n    - $brooklyn:object:\n        type: com.acme.brooklyn.MyMachineLocationCustomizer\nTo register MachineLocationCustomizer instances programmatically, set the config key\nCloudLocationConfig.MACHINE_LOCATION_CUSTOMIZERS on the location, or pass this \nconfig option when calling location.obtain(options).\nHostname Customizer\norg.apache.brooklyn.entity.machine.SetHostnameCustomizer\nSets the hostname on an ssh'able machine. Currently only CentOS and RHEL are supported.\nThe customizer can be configured with a hard-coded hostname, or with a freemarker template whose value (after substitutions) will be used for the hostname.\n\nsection: Customizing Cloud Security Groups\nsection_position: 12\nsection_type: inline\nCustomizing Cloud Security Groups\nBefore using SharedLocationSecurityGroupCustomizer, please first refer to Port Inferencing.\nA security group is a named collection of network access rules that are use to limit the types of traffic that have access to instances.\nSecurity group is the standard way to set firewall restrictions on the AWS-EC2 environment.\ndocs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html\nWhen deploying to AWS EC2 target, by default Apache Brooklyn creates security group attached to the VM.\nIt is easy to add additional rules to the initial security group using org.apache.brooklyn SharedLocationSecurityGroupCustomizer.\nYAML Example:\nname: ports @ AWS\nlocation: jclouds:aws-ec2:us-west-2:\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.EmptySoftwareProcess\n  brooklyn.config:\n    provisioning.properties:\n      customizers:\n      - $brooklyn:object:\n          type: org.apache.brooklyn.location.jclouds.networking.SharedLocationSecurityGroupCustomizer\n          object.fields: {tcpPortRanges: [\"900-910\", \"915\", \"22\"], udpPortRanges: [\"100\",\"200-300\"], cidr: \"82.40.153.101/24\"}\nMake sure that you have rule which makes port 22 accessible from Apache Brooklyn.\nOpening ports during runtime.\nApache Brooklyn exposes the SharedLocationSecurityGroupCustomizer functionality after entity is deployed \njust by supplying effector.add.openInboundPorts: true \"brooklyn.config\".\nExample configuration in effector\nlocation: jclouds:aws-ec2:us-west-2\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.software.base.EmptySoftwareProcess\n  brooklyn.config:\n    effector.add.openInboundPorts: true\nKnown limitations\nNot all cloud providers support Security Group abstraction.\nSharedLocationSecurityGroupCustomizer is known to work well with Amazon EC2.\nOther clouds which support Security Groups:\n\nOpenstack\nAzure - jclouds-labs azurecompute implementation uses endpoints rules when creating a VM instance.\njclouds:azurecompute based location do not have security groups so SharedLocationSecurityGroupCustomizer is used it will fail to find a security group.\n\n\nsection: Specialized Locations\nsection_position: 13\nsection_type: inline\nSpecialized Locations\nSome additional location types are supported for specialized situations:\nSingle Host\nThe spec host, taking a string argument (the address) or a map (host, user, password, etc.),\nprovides a convenient syntax when specifying a single host.\nFor example:\nlocation: host:(192.168.0.1)\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.jboss.JBoss7Server\n\nOr, in brooklyn.properties, set brooklyn.location.named.host1=host:(192.168.0.1).\nThe Multi Location\nThe spec multi allows multiple locations, specified as targets,\nto be combined and treated as one location.\nSequential Consumption\nIn its simplest form, this will use the first target location where possible,\nand will then switch to the second and subsequent locations when there are no\nmachines available.\nIn the example below, it provisions the first node to 192.168.0.1, then it provisions into AWS\nus-east-1 region (because the bring-your-own-nodes region will have run out of nodes).\nlocation:\n  multi:\n    targets:\n    - byon:(hosts=192.168.0.1)\n    - jclouds:aws-ec2:us-east-1\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.group.DynamicCluster\n  brooklyn.config:\n    cluster.initial.size: 3\n    dynamiccluster.memberspec:\n      $brooklyn:entitySpec:\n        type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.machine.MachineEntity\n\nRound-Robin Consumption and Availability Zones for Clustered Applications\nA DynamicCluster can be configured to cycle through its deployment targets round-robin when\nprovided with a location that supports the AvailabilityZoneExtension -- the multi location\nsupports this extension.\nThe configuration option dynamiccluster.zone.enable on DynamicCluster tells it to query the\ngiven location for AvailabilityZoneExtension support. If the location supports it, then the\ncluster will query for the list of availability zones (which in this case is simply the list of\ntargets) and deploy to them round-robin.\nIn the example below, the cluster will request VMs round-robin across three different\nlocations (in this case, the locations were already added to the catalog, or defined in\nbrooklyn.properties).\nlocation:\n  multi:\n    targets:\n    - my-location-1\n    - my-location-2\n    - my-location-3\nservices:\n- type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.group.DynamicCluster\n  brooklyn.config:\n    dynamiccluster.zone.enable: true\n    cluster.initial.size: 3\n    dynamiccluster.memberspec:\n      $brooklyn:entitySpec:\n        type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.machine.MachineEntity\n\nOf course, clusters can also be deployed round-robin to real availability zones offered by\ncloud providers, as long as their locations support AvailabilityZoneExtension.

These jars will \nbe at the end of the classpath.\nThe initial classpath, as set in the brooklyn script, is:\nconf:lib/patch/*:lib/brooklyn/*:lib/dropins/*\nAdditional entries can be added at the head of the classpath by setting the environment variable \nBROOKLYN_CLASSPATH before running the brooklyn script. \nReplacing the web-console\nWork in progress.\nThe Brooklyn web-console is loaded from the classpath as the resource classpath://brooklyn.war.\nTo replace this, an alternative WAR with that name can be added at the head of the classpath.\nHowever, this approach is likely to change in a future release - consider this feature as \"beta\".\nCloud Explorer\nThe brooklyn command line tool includes support for querying (and managing) cloud\ncompute resources and blob-store resources. \nFor example, brooklyn cloud-compute list-instances --location aws-ec2:eu-west-1\nwill use the AWS credentials from brooklyn.properties and list the VM instances\nrunning in the given EC2 region.\nUse brooklyn help and brooklyn help cloud-compute to find out more information.\nThis functionality is not intended as a generic cloud management CLI, but instead \nsolves specific Brooklyn use-cases.

Values can be viewed and managed dynamically via the OSGI configuration admin commands in Karaf,\ne.g. config:property-set. The global ~/.brooklyn/brooklyn.properties is still supported and has higher\npriority for duplicate keys, but it's values can't be manipulated with the Karaf commands, so its use is\ndiscouraged.\nYou can use the standard ~/.brooklyn/brooklyn.properties file to configure Brooklyn.

Point the \"webconsole\" login service\nto the JAAS realm you would like to use.\nFor other Jetty related configuration consult the Karaf and pax-web docs.\n\n\n\nMemory Usage\nThe amount of memory required by Apache Brooklyn process depends on the usage - for example the number of entities/VMs under management.\nFor a standard Brooklyn deployment, the defaults are to start with 256m, and to grow to 2g of memory. These numbers can be overridden \nby setting the JAVA_MAX_MEM and JAVA_MAX_PERM_MEM in the bin/setenv script:\nexport JAVA_MAX_MEM=\"2G\"\nApache Brooklyn stores a task history in-memory using soft references. \nThis means that, once the task history is large, Brooklyn will continually use the maximum allocated memory. It will \nonly expunge tasks from memory when this space is required for other objects within the Brooklyn process.\nAuthentication and Security\nThere are two areas of authentication used in Apache Brooklyn, these are as follows:\n\nKaraf authentication\n\nApache Brooklyn uses Apache Karaf as a core platform, this has user level security and\ngroups which can be configured as detailed here.\n\nApache Brooklyn authentication\n\nUsers and passwords for Brooklyn can be configured in the brooklyn.cfg as detailed here.\nHTTPS Configuration\nSee HTTPS Configuration for general information on configuring HTTPS.\n\n-- NOTE: comment out this section on catalog as the behaviour described is not enabled by default since\n-- https://github.com/apache/brooklyn-server/pull/233; re-enable this when that changes\nCatalog in Karaf\nWith the traditional launcher, Brooklyn loads the initial contents of the catalog from a default.catalog.bom file\nas described in the section on installation. Brooklyn finds Java \nimplementations to provide for certain things in blueprints (entities, enrichers etc.) by scanning the classpath. \nIn the OSGI world this approach is not used, as each bundle only has visibility of its own and its imported Java packages. \nInstead, in Karaf, each bundle can declare its own catalog.bom file, in the root of the bundle,\nwith the catalog declarations for any entities etc. that the bundle contains.\nFor example, the catalog.bom file for Brooklyn's Webapp bundle looks like (abbreviated):\nbrooklyn.catalog:\n    version: ...\n    items:\n    - id: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.nodejs.NodeJsWebAppService\n      itemType: entity\n      item:\n        type: org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.nodejs.NodeJsWebAppService\n        name: Node.JS Application\n    ...\n    - id: resilient-bash-web-cluster-template\n      itemType: template\n      name: \"Template: Resilient Load-Balanced Bash Web Cluster with Sensors\"\n      description: |\n        Sample YAML to provision a cluster of the bash/python web server nodes,\n        with sensors configured, and a load balancer pointing at them,\n        and resilience policies for node replacement and scaling\n      item:\n        name: Resilient Load-Balanced Bash Web Cluster (Brooklyn Example)\nIn the above YAML the first item declares that the bundle provides an entity whose type is\norg.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.nodejs.NodeJsWebAppService, and whose name is 'Node.JS Application'.  The second\nitem declares that the bundle provides a template application, with id  resilient-bash-web-cluster-template, and\nincludes a description for what this is.\nConfiguring the applications in the Catalog\nWhen running some particular deployment of Brooklyn it may not be desirable for the sample applications to appear in\nthe catalog (for clarity, \"application\" here in the sense of an item with itemType: template).\nFor example, if you have developed\nsome bundle with your own application and added it to Karaf then you might want only your own application to appear in\nthe catalog.\nBrooklyn contains a mechanism to allow you to configure what bundles will add their applications to the catalog.\nThe Karaf configuration file /etc/org.apache.brooklyn.core.catalog.bomscanner.cfg contains two properties,\none whitelist and the other blacklist, that bundles must satisfy for their applications to be added to the catalog.\nEach property value is a comma-separated list of regular expressions.  The symbolic id of the bundle must match one of\nthe regular expressions on the whitelist, and not match any expression on the blacklist, if its applications\nare to be added to the bundle.  The default values of these properties are to admit all bundles, and forbid none.\nCaveats\nIn the OSGi world specifying class names by string in Brooklyn's configuration will work only\nfor classes living in Brooklyn's core modules. Raise an issue or ping us on IRC if you find\na case where this doesn't work for you. For custom SecurityProvider implementations refer to the\ndocumentation of BrooklynLoginModule.\n END Catalog in Karaf comment -->\n"},"ops/persistence/":{"url":"ops/persistence/","title":"Persistence","keywords":"","body":"By default Brooklyn persists its state to storage so that a server can be restarted \nwithout loss or so a high availability standby server can take over.\nBrooklyn can persist its state to one of two places: the file system, or to an object store\nof your choice.\nConfiguration\nTo configure persistence, edit the file org.apache.brooklyn.osgilauncher.cfg in the etc\ndirectory of your Brooklyn instance. The following options are available:\npersistMode - This is the mode in which persistence is running, in and is set to AUTO by default. The possible values are:\n\nAUTO - will rebind to any existing state, or start up fresh if no state;\nDISABLED - will not read or persist any state;\nREBIND - will rebind to the existing state, or fail if no state available;\nCLEAN - will start up fresh (removing any existing state)\n\npersistenceDir - This is the directory to which Apache Brooklyn reads and writes its persistence data. The default location depends\non your installation method. Checkout this page for more information.\npersistenceLocation - This is the location for an object store to read and write persisted state.\npersistPeriod - This is an interval period which can be set to reduce the frequency with which persistence\nis carried out, for example 1s.\nFile-based Persistence\nApache Brooklyn starts with file-based persistence by default, saving data in the persisted state folder.\nFor the rest of this document we will refer to this location as %persistence-home%.\nIf there is already data at %persistence-home%/data, then a backup of the directory will \nbe made. This will have a name like %persistence-home%/backups/%date%-%time%-jvyX7Wis-promotion-igFH.\nThis means backups of the data directory will be automatically created each time Brooklyn \nis restarted (or if a standby Brooklyn instances takes over as master).\nThe state is written to the given path. The file structure under that path is:\n\n./catalog/\n./enrichers/\n./entities/\n./feeds/\n./locations/\n./nodes/\n./plane/\n./policies/\n\nIn each of those directories, an XML file will be created per item - for example a file per\nentity in ./entities/. This file will capture all of the state - for example, an\nentity's: id; display name; type; config; attributes; tags; relationships to locations, child \nentities, group membership, policies and enrichers; and dynamically added effectors and sensors.\nObject Store Persistence\nApache Brooklyn can persist its state to any Object Store API supported by Apache jclouds including \nS3, Swift and Azure. \nThis gives access to any compatible Object Store product or cloud provider including AWS-S3, \nSoftLayer, Rackspace, HP and Microsoft Azure. For a complete list of supported\nproviders, see jclouds.\nTo configure the Object Store, add the credentials to brooklyn.cfg such as:\nbrooklyn.location.named.aws-s3-eu-west-1=aws-s3:eu-west-1\nbrooklyn.location.named.aws-s3-eu-west-1.identity=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU\nbrooklyn.location.named.aws-s3-eu-west-1.credential=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890ab/c\n\nor:\nbrooklyn.location.named.softlayer-swift-ams01=jclouds:openstack-swift:https://ams01.objectstorage.softlayer.net/auth/v1.0\nbrooklyn.location.named.softlayer-swift-ams01.identity=ABCDEFGHIJKLM:myname\nbrooklyn.location.named.softlayer-swift-ams01.credential=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz12\nbrooklyn.location.named.softlayer-swift-ams01.jclouds.keystone.credential-type=tempAuthCredentials\n\nThen edit the persistenceLocation to point at this object store: softlayer-swift-ams01.\nRebinding to State\nWhen Brooklyn starts up pointing at existing state, it will recreate the entities, locations \nand policies based on that persisted state.\nOnce all have been created, Brooklyn will \"manage\" the entities. This will bind to the \nunderlying entities under management to update the each entity's sensors (e.g. to poll over \nHTTP or JMX). This new state will be reported in the web-console and can also trigger \nany registered policies.\nHandling Rebind Failures\nIf rebind fails fail for any reason, details of the underlying failures will be reported \nin the brooklyn.debug.log. This will include the entities, locations or policies which caused an issue, and in what \nway it failed. There are several approaches to resolving problems.\n1) Determine Underlying Cause\nGo through the log and identify the likely areas in the code from the error message.\n2) Seek Help\n Help can be found by contacting the Apache Brooklyn mailing list.\n3) Fix-up the State\nThe state of each entity, location, policy and enricher is persisted in XML. \nIt is thus human readable and editable.\nAfter first taking a backup of the state, it is possible to modify the state. For example,\nan offending entity could be removed, or references to that entity removed, or its XML \ncould be fixed to remove the problem.\n4) Fixing with Groovy Scripts\nThe final (powerful and dangerous!) tool is to execute Groovy code on the running Brooklyn \ninstance. If authorized, the REST api allows arbitrary Groovy scripts to be passed in and \nexecuted. This allows the state of entities to be modified (and thus fixed) at runtime.\nIf used, it is strongly recommended that Groovy scripts are run against a disconnected Brooklyn\ninstance. After fixing the entities, locations and/or policies, the Brooklyn instance's \nnew persisted state can be copied and used to fix the production instance.\nWriting Persistable Code\nThe most common problem on rebind is that custom entity code has not been written in a way\nthat can be persisted and/or rebound.\nThe rule of thumb when implementing new entities, locations, policies and enrichers is that \nall state must be persistable. All state must be stored as config or as attributes, and must be\nserializable. For making backwards compatibility simpler, the persisted state should be clean.\nBelow are tips and best practices for when implementing an entity in Java (or any other \nJVM language).\nHow to store entity state:\n\nConfig keys and values are persisted.\nStore an entity's runtime state as attributes.\nDon't store state in arbitrary fields - the field will not be persisted (this is a design\ndecision, because Brooklyn cannot intercept the field being written to, so cannot know\nwhen to persist).\nDon't just modify the retrieved attribute value (e.g. getAttribute(MY_LIST).add(\"a\") is bad).\nThe value may not be persisted unless setAttribute() is called.\nFor special cases, it is possible to call entity.requestPerist() which will trigger\nasynchronous persistence of the entity.\nOverriding (and customizing) of getRebindSupport() is discouraged - this will change\nin a future version.\n\nHow to store policy/enricher/location state:\n\nStore values as config keys where applicable.\nUnfortunately these (currently) do not have attributes. Normally the state of a policy \nor enricher is transient - on rebind it starts afresh, for example with monitoring the \nperformance or health metrics rather than relying on the persisted values.\nFor special cases, you can annotate a field with @SetFromFlag for it be persisted. \nWhen you call requestPersist() then values of these fields will be scheduled to be \npersisted. Warning: the @SetFromFlag functionality may change in future versions.\n\nPersistable state:\n\nEnsure values can be serialized. This (currently) uses xstream, which means it does not\nneed to implement Serializable.\nAlways use static (or top-level) classes. Otherwise it will try to also persist the outer \ninstance!\nAny reference to an entity or location will be automatically swapped out for marker, and \nre-injected with the new entity/location instance on rebind. The same applies for policies,\nenrichers, feeds, catalog items and ManagementContext.\n\nBehaviour on rebind:\n\nBy extending SoftwareProcess, entities get a lot of the rebind logic for free. For \nexample, the default rebind() method will call connectSensors().\nSee SoftwareProcess Lifecycle\nfor more details.\nIf necessary, implement rebind. The entity.rebind() is called automatically by the\nBrooklyn framework on rebind, after configuring the entity's config/attributes but before \nthe entity is managed.\nNote that init() will not be called on rebind.\nFeeds will be persisted if and only if entity.addFeed(...) was called. Otherwise the\nfeed needs to be re-registered on rebind. Warning: this behaviour may change in future version.\nAll functions/predicates used with persisted feeds must themselves be persistable - \nuse of anonymous inner classes is strongly discouraged.\nSubscriptions (e.g. from calls to subscribe(...) for sensor events) are not persisted.\nThey must be re-registered on rebind.  Warning: this behaviour may change in future version.\n\nBelow are tips to make backwards-compatibility easier for persisted state: \n\nNever use anonymous inner classes - even in static contexts. The auto-generated class names \nare brittle, making backwards compatibility harder.\nAlways use sensible field names (and use transient whenever you don't want it persisted).\nThe field names are part of the persisted state.\nConsider using Value Objects for persisted values. This can give clearer separation of \nresponsibilities in your code, and clearer control of what fields are being persisted.\nConsider writing transformers to handle backwards-incompatible code changes.\nBrooklyn supports applying transformations to the persisted state, which can be done as \npart of an upgrade process.\n\nPersisted State Backup\nFile system backup\nWhen using the file system it is important to ensure it is backed up regularly.\nOne could use rsync to regularly backup the contents to another server.\nIt is also recommended to periodically create a complete archive of the state.\nA simple mechanism is to run a CRON job periodically (e.g. every 30 minutes) that creates an\narchive of the persistence directory, and uploads that to a backup \nfacility (e.g. to S3).\nOptionally, to avoid excessive load on the Brooklyn server, the archive-generation could be done \non another \"data\" server. This could get a copy of the data via an rsync job.\nAn example script to be invoked by CRON is shown below:\nDATE=`date \"+%Y%m%d.%H%M.%S\"`\nBACKUP_FILENAME=/path/to/archives/back-${DATE}.tar.gz\nDATA_DIR=/path/to/base/dir/data\n\ntar --exclude '*/backups/*' -czvf $BACKUP_FILENAME $DATA_DIR\n# For s3cmd installation see http://s3tools.org/repositories\ns3cmd put $BACKUP_FILENAME s3://mybackupbucket\nrm $BACKUP_FILENAME\nObject store backup\nObject Stores will normally handle replication. However, many such object stores do not handle \nversioning (i.e. to allow access to an old version, if an object has been incorrectly changed or \ndeleted).\nThe state can be downloaded periodically from the object store, archived and backed up. \nAn example script to be invoked by CRON is shown below:\nDATE=`date \"+%Y%m%d.%H%M.%S\"`\nBACKUP_FILENAME=/path/to/archives/back-${DATE}.tar.gz\nTEMP_DATA_DIR=/path/to/tempdir\n\nbrooklyn copy-state \\\n        --persistenceLocation named:my-persistence-location \\\n        --persistenceDir /path/to/bucket \\\n        --destinationDir $TEMP_DATA_DIR\n\ntar --exclude '*/backups/*' -czvf $BACKUP_FILENAME $TEMP_DATA_DIR\n# For s3cmd installation see http://s3tools.org/repositories\ns3cmd put $BACKUP_FILENAME s3://mybackupbucket\nrm $BACKUP_FILENAME\nrm -r $TEMP_DATA_DIR\n"},"ops/high-availability/":{"url":"ops/high-availability/","title":"High Availability","keywords":"","body":"Brooklyn will automatically run in HA mode if multiple Brooklyn instances are started\npointing at the same persistence store.

Standby nodes do not attempt to rebind\nuntil they are elected master, so the state of existing entities is not available at\nthe standby node.  However a standby server consumes very little resource until it is\npromoted.\n\nIn HOT_STANDBY mode, a Brooklyn instance will read and make available the live state of\nentities.  Thus a hot-standby node is available as a read-only copy.\nAs with the standby node, if a hot-standby node detects that the master fails,\nit will be a candidate for promotion to master.\n\nIn HOT_BACKUP mode, a Brooklyn instance will read and make available the live state of\nentities, as a read-only copy.

For simplicity, a shared NFS folder\nis assumed in this example\nLaunching\nTo start, download and install the latest Apache Brooklyn release on both VMs following the instructions in\nRunning Apache Brooklyn\nOn the first VM, which will be the master node, set the following configuration options in org.apache.brooklyn.osgilauncher.cfg:\n\nhighAvailabilityMode: MASTER\npersistMode: AUTO\npersistenceDir: /mnt/brooklyn-persistence\n\nThen launch Brooklyn with:\n$ bin/start\n\nIf you are using RPMs/deb to install, please see the Running Apache Brooklyn \ndocumentation for the appropriate launch commands\nOnce Brooklyn has launched, on the second VM, set the following configuration options in org.apache.brooklyn.osgilauncher.cfg:\n\nhighAvailabilityMode: AUTO\npersistMode: AUTO\npersistenceDir: /mnt/brooklyn-persistence\n\nThen launch the standby Brooklyn with:\n$ bin/start\n\nFailover\nWhen running as a HA standby node, each standby Brooklyn server (in this case there is only one standby) will check the shared persisted state\nevery one second to determine the state of the HA master. If no heartbeat has been recorded for 30 seconds, then an election will be performed\nand one of the standby nodes will be promoted to master. At this point all requests should be directed to the new master node.\nIf the master is terminated gracefully, the secondary will be immediately promoted to mater. Otherwise, the secondary will be promoted after \nheartbeats are missed for a given length of time. This defaults to 30 seconds, and is configured in brooklyn.cfg using \nbrooklyn.ha.heartbeatTimeout\nIn the event that tasks - such as the provisioning of a new entity - are running when a failover occurs, the new master will display the current\nstate of the entity, but will not resume its provisioning or re-run any partially completed tasks. In this case it may be necessary\nto remove the entity and reprovision it. In the case of a failover whilst executing a task called by an effector, it may be possible to simple\ncall the effector again\nClient Configuration\nIt is the responsibility of the client to connect to the master Brooklyn server. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways:\n\nReverse Proxy\nTo allow the client application to automatically fail over in the event of a master server becoming unavailable, or the promotion of a new master,\na reverse proxy can be configured to route traffic depending on the response returned by https://:8443/v1/server/ha/state (see above).\nIf a server returns \"MASTER\", then traffic should be routed to that server, otherwise it should not be. The client software should be configured\nto connect to the reverse proxy server and no action is required by the client in the event of a failover. It can take up to 30 seconds for the\nstandby to be promoted, so the reverse proxy should retry for at least this period, or the failover time should be reconfigured to be shorter\n\nRe-allocating an Elastic IP on Failover\nIf the cloud provider you are using supports Elastic or Floating IPs, then the IP address should be allocated to the HA master, and the client\napplication configured to connect to the floating IP address. In the event of a failure of the master node, the standby node will automatically\nbe promoted to master, and the floating IP will need to be manually re-allocated to the new master node. No action is required by the client\nin the event of a failover. It is possible to automate the re-allocation of the floating IP if the Brooklyn servers are deployed and managed\nby Brooklyn using the entity org.apache.brooklyn.entity.brooklynnode.BrooklynCluster\n\nClient-based failover\nIn this scenario, the responsibilty for determining the Brooklyn master server falls on the client application. When configuring the client\napplication, a list of all servers in the cluster is passed in at application startup. On first connection, the client application connects to\nany of the members of the cluster to retrieve the HA states (see above). The JSON object returned is used to determine the addresses of all\nmembers of the cluster, and also to determine which node is the HA master\nIn the event of a failure of the master node, the client application should then retrieve the HA states of the cluster from any of the other cluster\nmembers. This is the same process as when the application first connects to the cluster. The client should refresh its list of cluster memebers\nand determine which node is the HA master\nIt is also recommended that the client application periodically checks the status of the cluster and updates its list of addresses. This will\nensure that failover is still possible if the standby server(s) has been replaced. It also allows additional standby servers to be added at any\ntime\n\n\nTesting\nYou can confirm that Brooklyn is running in high availibility mode on the master by logging into the web console at https://:8443.\nSimilarly you can log into the web console on the standby VM where you will see a warning that the server is not the high availability master.\nTo test a failover, you can simply terminate the process on the first VM and log into the web console on the second VM. Upon launch, Brooklyn will\noutput its PID to the file pid.txt; you can force an immediate (non-graceful) termination of the process by running the following command \nfrom the same directory from which you launched Brooklyn:\n$ kill -9 $(cat pid.txt)\n\nIt is also possiblity to check the high availability state of a running Brooklyn server using the following curl command:\n$ curl -k -u myusername:mypassword https://:8443/v1/server/ha/state\n\nThis will return one of the following states:\n\n\"INITIALIZING\"\n\"STANDBY\"\n\"HOT_STANDBY\"\n\"HOT_BACKUP\"\n\"MASTER\"\n\"FAILED\"\n\"TERMINATED\"\n\nNote: The quotation characters will be included in the reply\nTo obtain information about all of the nodes in the cluster, run the following command against any of the nodes in the cluster:\n$ curl -k -u myusername:mypassword https://:8443/v1/server/ha/states\n\nThis will return a JSON document describing the Brooklyn nodes in the cluster. An example of two HA Brooklyn nodes is as follows (whitespace formatting has been\nadded for clarity):\n\n{\n  ownId: \"XkJeXUXE\",\n  masterId: \"yAVz0fzo\",\n  nodes: {\n    yAVz0fzo: {\n      nodeId: \"yAVz0fzo\",\n      nodeUri: \"https://:8443/\",\n      status: \"MASTER\",\n      localTimestamp: 1466414301065,\n      remoteTimestamp: 1466414301000\n    },\n    XkJeXUXE: {\n      nodeId: \"XkJeXUXE\",\n      nodeUri: \"https://:8443/\",\n      status: \"STANDBY\",\n      localTimestamp: 1466414301066,\n      remoteTimestamp: 1466414301000\n    }\n  },\n  links: { }\n}\n\nThe examples above show how to use curl to manually check the status of Brooklyn via its REST API.

The same blueprint can be used to service both groups\nof users, with brooklyn.cfg changing the behaviour depending on the deployment environment.\nHere is the blueprint:\nname: MyApplication\nservices:\n- type: brooklyn.entity.webapp.jboss.JBoss7Server\n  name: AppServer HelloWorld\n  brooklyn.config:\n    wars.root: http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/apache/brooklyn/example/brooklyn-example-hello-world-sql-webapp/0.8.0-incubating/brooklyn-example-hello-world-sql-webapp-0.8.0-incubating.war\n    http.port: 8080+\n    java.sysprops:\n      brooklyn.example.db.url: \n        $brooklyn:formatString:\n          - jdbc:postgresql://%s/myappdb?user=%s\\\\&password=%s\n          - $brooklyn:external(\"servers\", \"postgresql\")\n          - $brooklyn:external(\"credentials\", \"postgresql-user\")\n          - $brooklyn:external(\"credentials\", \"postgresql-password\")\n\nYou can see that when we are building up the JDBC URL, we are using the external function. This takes two parameters:\nthe first is the name of the configuration supplier, the second is the name of a key that is stored by the configuration\nsupplier. In this case we are using two different suppliers: servers to store the location of the server, and\ncredentials which is a security-optimized supplier of secrets.\nDevelopers would add lines like this to the brooklyn.cfg file on their workstation:\nbrooklyn.external.servers=org.apache.brooklyn.core.config.external.InPlaceExternalConfigSupplier\nbrooklyn.external.servers.postgresql=127.0.0.1\nbrooklyn.external.credentials=org.apache.brooklyn.core.config.external.InPlaceExternalConfigSupplier\nbrooklyn.external.credentials.postgresql-user=admin\nbrooklyn.external.credentials.postgresql-password=admin\n\nIn this case, all of the required information is included in-line in the local brooklyn.cfg.\nWhereas in production, brooklyn.cfg might look like this:\nbrooklyn.external.servers=org.apache.brooklyn.core.config.external.PropertiesFileExternalConfigSupplier\nbrooklyn.external.servers.propertiesUrl=https://ops.example.com/servers.properties\nbrooklyn.external.credentials=org.apache.brooklyn.core.config.external.vault.VaultAppIdExternalConfigSupplier\nbrooklyn.external.credentials.endpoint=https://vault.example.com\nbrooklyn.external.credentials.path=secret/enterprise-postgres\nbrooklyn.external.credentials.appId=MyApp\n\nIn this case, the list of servers is stored in a properties file located on an Operations Department web server, and the\ncredentials are stored in an instance of Vault.\nMore information on these providers is below.\nFor demo purposes, there is a pre-defined external provider called\nbrooklyn-demo-sample which defines hidden-brooklyn-password as br00k11n.\nThis is used in some of the sample blueprints, referencing $brooklyn:external(\"brooklyn-demo-sample\", \"hidden-brooklyn-password\"). \nThe value used here can be overridden with the following in your brooklyn.cfg:\nbrooklyn.external.brooklyn-demo-sample=org.apache.brooklyn.core.config.external.InPlaceExternalConfigSupplier\nbrooklyn.external.brooklyn-demo-sample.hidden-brooklyn-password=new_password\n\nDefining Suppliers\nExternal configuration suppliers are defined in brooklyn.cfg. The minimal definition is of the form:\nbrooklyn.external.supplierName = className\nThis defines a supplier named supplierName. Brooklyn will attempt to instantiate className; it is this class which\nwill provide the behaviour of how to retrieve data from the supplier. Brooklyn includes a number of supplier\nimplementations; see below for more details.\nSuppliers may require additional configuration options. These are given as additional properties in\nbrooklyn.cfg:\nbrooklyn.external.supplierName = className\nbrooklyn.external.supplierName.firstConfig = value\nbrooklyn.external.supplierName.secondConfig = value\n\nReferring to External Configuration in Blueprints\nExternalized configuration adds a new function to the Brooklyn blueprint language DSL, $brooklyn:external. This\nfunction takes two parameters:\n\nsupplier\nkey\n\nWhen resolving the external reference, Brooklyn will first identify the supplier of the information, then it will\ngive the supplier the key. The returned value will be substituted into the blueprint.\nYou can use $brooklyn:external directly:\nname: MyApplication\nbrooklyn.config:\n  example: $brooklyn:external(\"supplier\", \"key\")\n\nor embed the external function inside another $brooklyn DSL function, such as $brooklyn:formatString:\nname: MyApplication\nbrooklyn.config:\n  example: $brooklyn:formatString(\"%s\", external(\"supplier\", \"key\"))\n\nReferring to External Configuration in brooklyn.cfg\nThe same blueprint language DSL can be used from brooklyn.cfg. For example:\nbrooklyn.location.jclouds.aws-ec2.identity=$brooklyn:external(\"mysupplier\", \"aws-identity\")\nbrooklyn.location.jclouds.aws-ec2.credential=$brooklyn:external(\"mysupplier\", \"aws-credential\")\n\nReferring to External Configuration in Catalog Items\nThe same blueprint language DSL can be used within YAML catalog items. For example:\nbrooklyn.catalog:\n  id: com.example.myblueprint\n  version: \"1.2.3\"\n  itemType: entity\n  brooklyn.libraries:\n  - >\n    $brooklyn:formatString(\"https://%s:%s@repo.example.com/libs/myblueprint-1.2.3.jar\", \n    external(\"mysupplier\", \"username\"), external(\"mysupplier\", \"password\"))\n  item:\n    type: com.example.MyBlueprint\nNote the > in the example above is used to split across multiple lines.\nSuppliers available with Brooklyn\nBrooklyn ships with a number of external configuration suppliers ready to use.\nIn-place\nInPlaceExternalConfigSupplier embeds the configuration keys and values as properties inside brooklyn.cfg.\nFor example:\nbrooklyn.external.servers=org.apache.brooklyn.core.config.external.InPlaceExternalConfigSupplier\nbrooklyn.external.servers.postgresql=127.0.0.1\n\nThen, a blueprint which referred to $brooklyn:external(\"servers\", \"postgresql\") would receive the value 127.0.0.1.\nProperties file\nPropertiesFileExternalConfigSupplier loads a properties file from a URL, and uses the keys and values in this\nfile to respond to configuration lookups.\nGiven this configuration:\nbrooklyn.external.servers=org.apache.brooklyn.core.config.external.PropertiesFileExternalConfigSupplier\nbrooklyn.external.servers.propertiesUrl=https://ops.example.com/servers.properties\n\nThis would cause the supplier to download the given URL. Assuming that the file contained this entry:\npostgresql=127.0.0.1\n\nThen, a blueprint which referred to $brooklyn:external(\"servers\", \"postgresql\") would receive the value 127.0.0.1.\nVault\nVault is a server-based tool for managing secrets. Brooklyn provides suppliers that are\nable to query the Vault REST API for configuration values. The different suppliers implement alternative authentication\noptions that Vault provides.\nFor all of the authentication methods, you must always set these properties in brooklyn.cfg:\nbrooklyn.external.supplierName.endpoint=\nbrooklyn.external.supplierName.path=\n\nFor example, if the path is set to secret/brooklyn, then attempting to retrieve the key foo would cause Brooklyn\nto retrieve the value of the foo key on the secret/brooklyn object. This value can be set using the Vault CLI\nlike this:\nvault write secret/brooklyn foo=bar\n\nAuthentication by username and password\nThe userpass plugin for Vault allows authentication with username and password.\nbrooklyn.external.supplierName=org.apache.brooklyn.core.config.external.vault.VaultUserPassExternalConfigSupplier\nbrooklyn.external.supplierName.username=fred\nbrooklyn.external.supplierName.password=s3kr1t\n\nAuthentication using App ID\nThe app_id plugin for Vault allows you to specify an \"app ID\", and then designate particular \"user IDs\" to be part\nof the app. Typically the app ID would be known and shared, but user ID would be autogenerated on the client in some\nway. Brooklyn implements this by determining the MAC address of the server running Brooklyn (expressed as 12 lower\ncase hexadecimal digits without separators) and passing this as the user ID.\nbrooklyn.external.supplierName=org.apache.brooklyn.core.config.external.vault.VaultAppIdExternalConfigSupplier\nbrooklyn.external.supplierName.appId=MyApp\n\nIf you do not wish to use the MAC address as the user ID, you can override it with your own choice of user ID:\nbrooklyn.external.supplierName.userId=server3.cluster2.europe\n\nAuthentication by fixed token\nIf you have a fixed token string, then you can use the VaultTokenExternalConfigSupplier class and provide the token\nin brooklyn.cfg:\nbrooklyn.external.supplierName=org.apache.brooklyn.core.config.external.vault.VaultTokenExternalConfigSupplier\nbrooklyn.external.supplierName.token=1091fc84-70c1-b266-b99f-781684dd0d2b\n\nThis supplier is suitable for \"smoke testing\" the Vault supplier using the Initial Root Token or similar. However it\nis not suitable for production use as it is inherently insecure - should the token be compromised, an attacker could\nhave complete access to your Vault, and the cleanup operation would be difficult. Instead you should use one of the\nother suppliers.\nWriting Custom External Configuration Suppliers\nSupplier implementations must conform to the brooklyn.config.external.ExternalConfigSupplier interface, which is very\nsimple:\nString getName();\nString get(String key);\n\nClasses implementing this interface can be placed in the lib/dropins folder of Brooklyn, and then the supplier\ndefined in brooklyn.cfg as normal.\n"},"ops/requirements.html":{"url":"ops/requirements.html","title":"Requirements","keywords":"","body":"Server Specification\nThe size of server required by Brooklyn depends on the amount of activity. This includes:\n\nthe number of entities/VMs being managed\nthe number of VMs being deployed concurrently\nthe amount of management and monitoring required per entity\n\nFor dev/test or when there are only a handful of VMs being managed, a small VM is sufficient.\nFor example, an AWS m3.medium with one vCPU, 3.75GiB RAM and 4GB disk.\nFor larger production uses, a more appropriate machine spec would be two or more cores,\nat least 8GB RAM and 100GB disk. The disk is just for logs, a small amount of persisted state, and\nany binaries for custom blueprints/integrations.\nDisk Space\nThere are three main consumers of disk space:\n\nStatic files: these are the Apache Brooklyn distribution with its own\ndependencies, OSGi bundles for custom blueprints and integrations installed to the deploy/ directory,\nplus data/ directory which is generated on first launch.\nNote that Brooklyn requires that Java is installed which\nyou may have to consider when calculating disk space requirements.\nPersisted state: when using Persistence -- which\nis a prerequisite for High Availability -- Brooklyn\nwill save data to a store location. Items in the persisted state include\nmetadata about the Brooklyn servers, catalog items, and metadata about all\nrunning applications and entities.\nLog files: Brooklyn writes info and debug log files. By default, these are\nwritten to the local filesystem. This can be reconfigured to set the\ndestination and to increase or decrease the detail in the logs. See the\nLogging section for more details.\n\nThe Apache Brooklyn distribution itself, when unpacked, consumes approximately\n75MB of disk space. This includes everything needed to run Brooklyn except for a\nJava VM. The space consumed by additional binaries for custom blueprints and\nintegrations is application-specific.\nPersisted state, excluding catalog data, is relatively small, starting at\napproximately 300KB for a clean, idle Brooklyn server. Deploying blueprints will\nadd to this - how much depends exactly on the entities involved and is therefore\napplication specific, but as a guideline, a 3-node Riak cluster adds\napproximately 500KB to the persistence store.\nLog data can be a large consumer of disk space. By default Brooklyn generates\ntwo logfiles, one which logs notable information only, and another which logs at\na debug level. Each logfile rotates when it hits a size of 100MB; a maximum of\n10 log files are retained for each type. The two logging streams combined,\ntherefore, can consume up to 2GB of disk space.\nIn the default configuration of Brooklyn's .tar.gz and .zip distributions,\nlogs are saved to the Brooklyn installation directory. You will most likely want\nto reconfigure Brooklyn's logging to save logs to a location\nelsewhere. In the .rpm and .deb packaging, logging files will be located\nunder /var/log. You can further reconfiguring the logging detail level and log\nrotation according to your organisation's policy.\nOS Requirements\nBrooklyn is tested against CentOS (6 or later), RHEL (6 or later), Ubuntu (14.04 or later), OS X, and Windows.\nSoftware Requirements\nBrooklyn requires Java 8 (JRE or JDK) or later.\nOpenJDK is recommended. Brooklyn has also been tested on the Oracle JVM and IBM J9.\nConfiguration Requirements\nPorts\nThe ports used by Brooklyn are:\n\n8443 for https, to expose the web-console and REST api.\n8081 for http, to expose the web-console and REST api.\n\nWhether to use https rather than http is configurable using the CLI option --https; \nthe port to use is configurable using the CLI option --port .\nTo enable remote Brooklyn access, ensure these ports are open in the firewall.\nFor example, to open port 8443 in iptables, ues the command:\n/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p TCP --dport 8443 -j ACCEPT\nLocale\nBrooklyn expects a sensible set of locale information and time zones to be available;\nwithout this, some time-and-date handling may be surprising.\nBrooklyn parses and reports times according to the time zone set at the server.\nIf Brooklyn is targetting geographically distributed users, \nit is normally recommended that the server's time zone be set to UTC.\nUser Setup\nIt is normally recommended that Brooklyn run as a non-root user with keys installed to ~/.ssh/id_rsa{,.pub}. \nLinux Kernel Entropy\nCheck that the linux kernel entropy is sufficient.\nSystem Resource Limits\nCheck that the ulimit values are sufficiently high.\n"},"ops/upgrade.html":{"url":"ops/upgrade.html","title":"Upgrade","keywords":"","body":"This guide provides all necessary information to upgrade Apache Brooklyn for both the RPM/DEB and Tarball packages.\nBackwards Compatibility\nApache Brooklyn version 0.12.0 onward runs primarily inside a Karaf container.

To perform a rollback, please follow these instructions:\n# CentOS / RHEL\nyum downgrade apache-brooklyn.noarch\n\n# Ubuntu Debian\ndpkg -i apache-brooklyn-xxxx.all.deb\n\nNote that to downgrade a DEB package is essentially installing a previous version therefore you need to download\nthe version you want to downgrade to before hand.\nHow to stop your service\nOn systemd: \nsystemctl stop brooklyn\n\nOn upstart: \nstop brooklyn\n\nWeb login credentials\n\nUser credentials should now be recorded in brooklyn.cfg.\n\nBrooklyn will still read them from both brooklyn.cfg and ~/.brooklyn/brooklyn.properties.\n\nConfigure a username/password by modifying brooklyn.cfg. An example entry is:\n\n\nbrooklyn.webconsole.security.users=admin\nbrooklyn.webconsole.security.user.admin.password=password2\n\nPersistence\nIf you have persisted state you wish to rebind to, persistence is now configured in the following files:\n\nbrooklyn.cfg\norg.apache.brooklyn.osgilauncher.cfg\n\nFor example, to use S3 for the persisted state, add the following to brooklyn.cfg:\nbrooklyn.location.named.aws-s3-eu-west-1:aws-s3:eu-west-1\nbrooklyn.location.named.aws-s3-eu-west-1.identity=\nbrooklyn.location.named.aws-s3-eu-west-1.credential=\n\nTo continue the S3 example, for the persisted state, add the following to org.apache.brooklyn.osgilauncher.cfg:\npersistenceLocation=aws-s3-eu-west-1\npersistenceDir=\n\nApache Brooklyn should be stopped before this file is modified, and then restarted with the new configuration.\nNote that you can not store the credentials (for e.g. aws-s3-eu-west-1) in the catalog because that catalog is stored\nin the persisted state. Apache Brooklyn needs to know it in order to read the persisted state at startup time.\nIf binding to existing persisted state, an additional command is required to update the existing catalog with the Brooklyn\n0.12.0 versions. Assuming Brooklyn has been installed to /opt/brooklyn (as is done by the RPM and DEB):\n    br catalog add /opt/brooklyn/catalog/catalog.bom\n\nAll existing custom jars previously added to lib/plugins (e.g. for Java-based entities) need to be converted to OSGi bundles,\nand installed in Karaf.

Most cloud \nproviders/APIs provide a mechanism to instead set an auto-generated password or to create an \nentry in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (prior to the VM being returned by the cloud provider).\nIf a hard-coded credential is used, then Brooklyn can be configured with this \"loginUser\" and \n\"loginUser.password\" (or \"loginUser.privateKeyData\"), and can change the password and disable \nroot login.\nVM Users\nIt is strongly discouraged to use the root user on VMs being created or managed by Brooklyn.\nSSH-ing on the VM should be done on rare cases such as initial Apache Brooklyn setup,\nApache Brooklyn upgrade and other important maintenance occasions.\nSSH keys\nUsers are strongly encouraged to use SSH keys for VM access, rather than passwords.\nThis SSH key could be a file on the Brooklyn server. However, a better solution is to use the \n\"externalised configuration\" to return the \"privateKeyData\". This better supports upgrading of \ncredentials.\nInstall Artifact Downloads\nWhen Brooklyn executes scripts on remote VMs to install software, it often requires downloading \nthe install artifacts. For example, this could be from an RPM repository or to retrieve .zip \ninstallers.\nBy default, the RPM repositories will be whatever the VM image is configured with. For artifacts \nto be downloaded directly, these often default to the public site (or mirror) for that software \nproduct.\nWhere users have a private RPM repository, it is strongly encouraged to ensure the VMs are \nconfigured to point at this.\nFor other artifacts, users should consider hosting these artifacts in their own web-server and \nconfiguring Brooklyn to use this.

Maven and Eclipse fight,\nneither quite gets along perfectly with Groovy,\ngit branch switches (sooo nice) can be slow, etc etc.\nBut with a bit of a dance the IDE can still be your friend,\nmaking it much easier to run tests and debug.\nAs a general tip, don't always trust the IDE to build correctly; if you hit a snag,\ndo a command-line mvn clean install (optionally with -DskipTests and/or -Dno-go-client)\nthen refresh the project.\nSee instructions below for specific IDEs.\nEclipse\nThe default Eclipse downloads already include all of the plugins needed for\nworking with the Brooklyn project. Optionally you can install the\nGroovy and TestNG plugins, but they are not required for building the project.\nYou can install these using Help -> Install New Software, or from the Eclipse Marketplace:\n\nGroovy Plugin: GRECLIPSE from\ndist.springsource.org/snapshot/GRECLIPSE/e4.5/;\nBe sure to include Groovy 2.3 compiler support and Maven-Eclipse (m2e) support.\nMore details including download sites for other versions can be found at the Groovy Eclipse Plugin site.\n\nTestNG Plugin: beust TestNG from beust.com/eclipse\n\n\nAs of this writing, Eclipse 4.5 and Eclipse 4.4 are commonly used,\nand the codebase can be imported (Import -> Existing Maven Projects)\nand successfully built and run inside an IDE.\nHowever there are quirks, and mileage may vary. Disable Build Automatically\nfrom the Project menu if the IDE is slow to respond.\nIf you encounter issues, the following hints may be helpful:\n\nIf m2e reports import problems, it is usually okay (even good) to mark all to \"Resolve All Later\".\nThe build-helper connector is useful if you're prompted for it, but\ndo not install the Tycho OSGi configurator (this causes show-stopping IAE's, and we don't need Eclipse to make bundles anyway).\nYou can manually mark as permanently ignored certain errors;\nthis updates the pom.xml (and should be current).\n\nA quick command-line build (mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dno-go-client) followed by a workspace refresh\ncan be useful to re-populate files which need to be copied to target/\n\nm2e likes to put excluding=\"**\" on resources directories; if you're seeing funny missing files\n(things like not resolving jclouds/aws-ec2 locations or missing WARs), try building clean install\nfrom the command-line then doing Maven -> Update Project (clean uses a maven-replacer-plugin to fix\n.classpaths).\nAlternatively you can go through and remove these manually in Eclipse (Build Path -> Configure)\nor the filesystem, or use\nthe following command to remove these rogue blocks in the generated .classpath files:\n\n\n% find . -name .classpath -exec sed -i.bak 's/[ ]*..cluding=\"[\\*\\/]*\\(\\.java\\)*\"//g' {} \\;\n\n\nYou may need to ensure src/main/{java,resources} is created in each project dir,\nif (older versions) complain about missing directories,\nand the same for src/test/{java,resources} if there are tests (src/test exists):\n\nfind . \\( -path \"*/src/main\" -or -path \"*/src/test\" \\) -exec echo {} \\; -exec mkdir -p {}/{java,resources} \\;\n\nIf the pain starts to be too much, come find us on IRC #brooklyncentral or\nelsewhere and we can hopefully share our pearls.\n(And if you have a tip we haven't mentioned please let us know that too!)\nIntelliJ IDEA\nTo develop or debug Brooklyn in IntelliJ, you will need to ensure that the Groovy and TestNG plugins are installed\nvia the IntelliJ IDEA | Preferences | Plugins menu. Once installed, you can open Brooklyn from the root folder,\n(e.g. ~/myfiles/brooklyn) which will automatically open the subprojects.\nBrooklyn has informally standardized on arranging import statements as per Eclipse's default configuration.\nIntelliJ's default configuration is different, which can result in unwanted \"noise\" in commits where imports are\nshuffled backward and forward between the two types - PRs which do this will likely fail the review. To avoid this,\nreconfigure IntelliJ to organize imports similar to Eclipse. See this StackOverflow answer\nfor a suitable configuration.\nNetbeans\nTips from Netbeans users wanted!\nDebugging Tips\nTo debug Brooklyn, create a launch configuration which launches the BrooklynJavascriptGuiLauncher class. NOTE: You may\nneed to add additional projects or folders to the classpath of the run configuration (e.g. add the brooklyn-software-nosql\nproject if you wish to deploy a MongoDBServer). You will also need to ensure that the working directory is set to the jsgui\nfolder. For IntelliJ, you can set the 'Working directory' of the Run/Debug Configuration to $MODULE_DIR$/../jsgui. For\nEclipse, use the default option of ${workspace_loc:brooklyn-jsgui}.\nTo debug the jsgui (the Brooklyn web console), you will need to build Brooklyn with -DskipOptimization to prevent the build from minifying the javascript.\nWhen building via the command line, use the command mvn clean install -DskipOptimization, and if you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you can add the option\nto the Maven Runner by clicking on the Maven Settings icon in the Maven Projects tool window  and adding the skipOptimization property with no value.\nWhen running at the command line you can enable remote connections so that one can attach a debugger to the Java process:\n    Run Java with the following on the command line or in JAVA_OPTS: -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005\nTo debug a brooklyn instance that has been run with the above JAVA_OPTS, create a remote build configuration (IntelliJ -\nRun | Edit Configurations | + | Remote) with the default options, ensuring the port matches the address specified in JAVA_OPTS.\n"},"dev/code/structure.html":{"url":"dev/code/structure.html","title":"Code Structure","keywords":"","body":"Brooklyn is split into the following subprojects:\n\nbrooklyn-server:\n\napi: the pure-Java interfaces for interacting with the system\ncamp: the components for a server which speaks with the CAMP REST API and understands the CAMP YAML plan language\ncore: the base class implementations for entities and applications, entity traits, locations, policies, sensor and effector support, tasks, and more\nkaraf: OSGi support\nlauncher: for launching brooklyn, either using a main method or invoked from the cli project\nlocations: specific location integrations\njclouds: integration with many cloud APIs and providers via Apache jclouds\n\n\nlogging: how we enable configurable logging\nlogback-includes: Various helpful logback XML files that can be included;

The\nApache license is flexible and compatible with many other types of license, meaning there is generally little problem\nwith incorporating other open source works into Brooklyn (with GPL being the notable exception). However diligence is\nrequired to ensure that the project is legally sound, and third parties are rightfully credited where appropriate.\nThis page is an interpretation of the Apache Legal Previously Asked Questions\npage as it specifically applies to the Brooklyn project, such as how we organise our code and the releases that we make.\nHowever this page is not authoritative; if there is any conflict between this page and the Previously Asked Questions or\nother Apache Legal authority, they will take precedence over this page.\nIf you have any doubt, please ask on the Brooklyn mailing list, and/or the Apache Legal mailing list.\nWhat code licenses can we bundle?\nApache Legal maintains the \"Category A\" list, which is a list\nof licenses that are compatible with the Apache License; that is, code under these licenses can be imported into\nBrooklyn without violating Brooklyn's Apache License nor the code's original license (subject to correctly modifying\nthe LICENSE and/or NOTICE files; see below).\nApache Legal also maintain the \"Category X\" list. Code licensed\nunder a Category X license cannot be imported into Brooklyn without violating either Brooklyn's Apache license or\nthe code's original license.\nThere is also a \"Category B\" list, which are licenses that are\ncompatible with the Apache license only under certain circumstances. In practice, this means that we can declare a\ndependency on a library licensed under a Category B license, and bundle the binary build of the library in our binary\nbuilds, but we cannot import its source code into the Brooklyn codebase.\nIf the code you are seeking to import does not appear on any of these lists, check to see if the license content is the\nsame as a known license. For example, many projects actually use a BSD license but do not label it as \"The BSD License\".\nIf you are still not certain about the license, please ask on the Brooklyn mailing list, and/or the Apache Legal mailing\nlist.\nAbout LICENSE and NOTICE files\nApache Legal requires that each artifact that the project releases contains a LICENSE and NOTICE file that is\naccurate for the contents of that artifact. This means that, potentially, every artifact that Brooklyn releases may\ncontain a different LICENSE and NOTICE file. In practice, it's not usually that complicated and there are only a\nfew variations of these files needed.\nFurthermore, accurate LICENSE and NOTICE files means that it correctly attributes the contents of the artifact,\nand it does not contain anything unnecessary. This provision is what prevents us creating a mega LICENSE file and using\nit in every single artifact we release, because in many cases it will contain information that is not relevant to an\nartifact.\nWhat is a correct LICENSE and NOTICE file?\n\nA correct LICENSE file is one that contains the text of the licence of any part of the code. The Apache Software\nLicense V2 will naturally be the first part of this file, as it's the license which we use for all the original code\nin Brooklyn. If some Category A licensed third-party code is bundled with this artifact, then the LICENSE file\nshould identify what the third-party code is, and include a copy of its license. For example, if jquery is bundled\nwith a web app, the LICENSE file would include a note jquery.js, its copyright and its license (MIT), and include a\nfull copy of the MIT license.\nA correct NOTICE file contains notices required by bundled third-party code above and beyond that which we have\nalready noted in LICENSE. In practice modifying NOTICE is rarely required beyond the initial note about Apache\nBrooklyn. See What Are Required Third-party Notices?\nfor more information\n\nApplying LICENSE and NOTICE files to Brooklyn\nWhen the Brooklyn project makes a release, we produce and release the following types of artifacts:\n\nOne source release artifact\nOne binary release artifact\nA large number of Maven release artifacts\n\nTherefore, our source release, our binary release, and every one of our Maven release artifacts, must each have\ntheir own, individually-tailored, LICENSE and NOTICE files.\nTo some extent, this is automated, using scripts in usage/dist/licensing;\nbut this must be manually run, and wherever source code is included or a project has insufficient information in its POM,\nyou'll need to add project-specific metadata (with a project-specific source-inclusions.yaml file and/or in the \ndist project's overrides.yaml file).  See the README.md in that project's folder for more information.\nMaven artifacts\nEach Maven module will generally produce a JAR file from code under src/main, and a JAR file from code under\nsrc/test. (There are some exceptions which may produce different artifacts.)\nIf the contents of the module are purely Apache Brooklyn original code, and the outputs are JAR files, then no action\nis required. The default build process will incorporate a general-purpose LICENSE and NOTICE file into all built\nJAR files. LICENSE will contain just a copy of the Apache Software License v2, and NOTICE will contain just the\nmodule's own notice fragment.\nHowever you will need to take action if either of these conditions are true:\n\nthe module produces an artifact that is not a JAR file - for example, the jsgui project produces a WAR file;\nthe module bundles third-party code that requires a change to LICENSE and/or NOTICE.\n\nIn this case you will need to disable the automatic insertion of LICENSE and NOTICE and insert your own versions\ninstead.\nFor an example of a JAR file with customized LICENSE/NOTICE files, refer to the usage/cli project.\nFor an example of a WAR file with customized LICENSE/NOTICE files, refer to the usage/jsgui project.\nThe source release\nIn practice, the source release contains nothing that isn't in the individual produced Maven artifacts (the obvious\ndifference about it being source instead of binary isn't relevant). Therefore, the source release LICENSE and NOTICE\ncan be considered to be the union of every Maven artifact's LICENSE and NOTICE. The amalgamated files are kept in\nthe root of the repository.\nThe binary release\nThis is the trickiest one to get right. The binary release includes everything that is in the source and Maven releases,\nplus every Java dependency of the project.

These are pretty good to run in the IDE (once you've completed IDE setup),\nand far quicker to spot problems than runtime, plus we get early-warning of problems introduced in the future.\n(In particular, Groovy's laxity with compilation means it is easy to introduce silly errors which good test coverage will find much faster.)\n\nIf you hit inexplicable problems at runtime, try clearing your Maven caches,\nor the brooklyn-relevant parts, under ~/.m2/repository.\nAlso note your IDE might be recompiling at the same time as a Maven command-line build,\nso consider turning off auto-build.\n\nWhen a class or method becomes deprecated, always include @deprecated in the Javadoc\ne.g. \"@deprecated since 0.7.0; instead use {@link ...}\"\n\nInclude when it was deprecated\nSuggest what to use instead -- e.g. link to alternative method, and/or code snippet, etc.\nConsider logging a warning message when a deprecated method or config option is used,\nsaying who is using it (e.g. useful if deprecated config keys are used in yaml) --\nif it's a method which might be called a lot, some convenience for \"warn once per entity\" would be helpful)\nSee the Java deprecation documentation\n\n\n\n\nEntity Design Tips\n\nLook at related entities and understand what they've done, in particular which\nsensors and config keys can be re-used.\n(Many are inherited from interfaces, where they are declared as constants,\ne.g. Attributes and UsesJmx.)\n\nUnderstand the location hierarchy:  software process entities typically get an SshMachineLocation,\nand use a *SshDriver to do what they need.  This will usually have a MachineProvisioningLocation parent, e.g. a\nJcloudsLocation (e.g. AWS eu-west-1 with credentials) or possibly a LocalhostMachineProvisioningLocation.\nClusters will take such a MachineProvisioningLocation (or a singleton list); fabircs take a list of locations.\nSome PaaS systems have their own location model, such as OpenShiftLocation.\n\nFinally, don't be shy about talking with others,\nthat's far better than spinning your wheels (or worse, having a bad experience),\nplus it means we can hopefully improve things for other people!\n\n\nYAML Blueprint Debugging\n\nBrooklyn will reject any YAML blueprint that contains syntax errors and will alert the user of such errors.\n\nHowever, it is possible to create a blueprint that is syntactically legal but results in runtime problems\nfor Brooklyn (for example, if an enricher's enricher.producer value is not immediately resolvable).\n\nIf Brooklyn appears to freeze after deploying a blueprint, run the jstack  command to view\nthe state of all running threads. By examining this output, it may become obvious which thread(s) are causing\nthe problem, and the details of the stack trace will provide insight into which part of the blueprint is\nincorrectly written.\n\n\nProject Maintenance\n\nAdding a new project may need updates to /pom.xml modules section and usage/all dependencies\n\nAdding a new example project may need updates to /pom.xml and /examples/pom.xml (and the documentation too!)\n\n\n"},"dev/tips/logging.html":{"url":"dev/tips/logging.html","title":"Logging","keywords":"","body":"Logging: A Quick Overview\nFor logging, we use logback which implements the slf4j API.\nThis means you can use any slf4j compliant logging framework,\nwith a default configuration which just works out of the box\nand bindings to the other common libraries (java.util.logging, log4j, ...)\nif you prefer one of those.\nOSGi based Apache Brooklyn\nWhile developing it may be useful to change logging level of some of the Apache Brooklyn modules.\nThe easiest way to do that is via the karaf console which can be started by bin/client.\n(Details regarding using Apache Brooklyn Karaf console)\nFor example if you would like to inspect jclouds API calls, enable jclouds.wire logging just enable it from karaf client.\nlog:set DEBUG jclouds.wire\nTo check other log levels.\nlog:list\nIf for some reason log level needs modified before the first start of Karaf\nthen you can modify the config file etc/org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg before hand.\nFor more information check\nhttps://ops4j1.jira.com/wiki/display/paxlogging/Configuration.\nClassic - non-OSGI based Apache Brooklyn\nTo use:\n\nUsers:\nIf using a brooklyn binary installation, simply edit the logback.xml\nor logback-custom.xml supplied in the archive, sometimes in a conf/\ndirectory.\n\nDevelopers:\nWhen setting up a new project, if you want logging it is recommended to include \nthe brooklyn-logback-xml project as an optional and provided maven dependency, \nand then to put custom logging configuration in either logback-custom.xml or logback-main.xml, \nas described below.\n\n\nCustomizing Your Logging\nThe project brooklyn-logback-xml supplies a logback.xml configuration,\nwith a mechanism which allows it to be easily customized, consumed, and overridden.\nYou may wish to include this as an optional dependency so that it is not forced\nupon downstream projects.  This logback.xml file supplied contains just one instruction,\nto include logback-main.xml, and that file in turn includes:\n\nlogback-custom.xml\nbrooklyn/logback-appender-file.xml\nbrooklyn/logback-appender-stdout.xml\nbrooklyn/logback-logger-excludes.xml\nbrooklyn/logback-debug.xml\n\nFor the most common customizations, simply create a logback-custom.xml on your classpath\n(ensuring it is loaded before brooklyn classes in classpath ordering in the pom)\nand supply your customizations there:  \n\n               \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\nFor other configuration, you can override individual files listed above.\nFor example:\n\nTo remove debug logging, create a trivial brooklyn/logback-debug.xml, \ncontaining simply .\nTo customise stdout logging, perhaps to give it a threshhold WARN instead of INFO,\ncreate a brooklyn/logback-appender-stdout.xml which defines an appender STDOUT.\nTo discard all brooklyn's default logging, create a logback-main.xml which \ncontains your configuration. This should look like a standard logback\nconfiguration file, except it should be wrapped in  XML tags rather\nthan  XML tags (because it is included from the logback.xml\nwhich comes with brooklyn-logback-xml.)\nTo redirect all jclouds logging to a separate file include brooklyn/logback-logger-debug-jclouds.xml.\nThis redirects all logging from org.jclouds and jclouds to one of two files: anything\nlogged from Brooklyn's persistence thread will end up in a persistence.log, everything else\nwill end up in jclouds.log.\n\nYou should not supply your own logback.xml if you are using brooklyn-logback-xml.\nIf you do, logback will detect multiple files with that name and will scream at you.\nIf you wish to supply your own logback.xml, do not include brooklyn-logback-xml.\n(Alternatively you can include a logback.groovy which causes logback to ignore logback.xml.)\nYou can set a specific logback config file to use with:\n-Dlogback.configurationFile=/path/to/config.xml\n\nAssemblies\nWhen building an assembly, it is recommended to create a conf/logback.xml which \nsimply includes logback-main.xml (which comes from the classpath).  Users of the assembly\ncan then edit the logback.xml file in the usual way, or they can plug in to the configuration \nmechanisms described above, by creating files such as logback-custom.xml under conf/.\nIncluding brooklyn-logback-xml as an optional and provided dependency means everything\nshould work correctly in IDE's but it will not include the extra logback.xml file in the assembly.\n(Alternatively if you include the conf/ dir in your IDE build, you should exclude this dependency.)\nWith this mechanism, you can include logback-custom.xml and/or other files underneath \nsrc/main/resources/ of a project, as described above (for instance to include custom\nlogging categories and define the log file name) and it should get picked up, \nboth in the IDE and in the assembly.   \nTests\nBrooklyn projects test scope includes the brooklyn-utils-test-support project\nwhich supplies a logback-test.xml. logback uses this file in preference to logback.xml\nwhen available (ie when running tests). However the logback-test.xml Brooklyn uses\nincludes the same logback-main.xml call path above, so your configurations should still work.\nThe only differences of the logback-test.xml configuration is that:\n\nDebug logging is included for all Brooklyn packages\nThe log file is called brooklyn-tests.log \n\nCaveats\n\nlogback uses SLF4J version 1.6 which is not compatible with 1.5.x. \nIf you have dependent projects using 1.5.x (such as older Grails) things may break.\n\nIf you're not getting the logging you expect in the IDE, make sure \nsrc/main/resources is included in the classpath.\n(In eclipse, right-click the project, the Build Path -> Configure,\nthen make sure all dirs are included (All) and excluded (None) -- \nmvn clean install should do this for you.)\n\nYou may find that your IDE logs to a file brooklyn-tests.log \nif it doesn't distinguish between test build classpaths and normal classpaths.\n\nLogging configuration using file overrides such as this is very sensitive to\nclasspath order. To get a separate brooklyn-tests.log file during testing,\nfor example, the brooklyn-test-support project with scope test must be\ndeclared as a dependency before brooklyn-logback-includes, due to the way\nboth files declare logback-appender-file.xml.\n\nSimilarly note that the logback-custom.xml file is included after \nlogging categories and levels are declared, but before appenders are declared,\nso that logging levels declared in that file dominate, and that \nproperties from that file apply to appenders.\n\nFinally remember this is open to improvement. It's the best system we've found\nso far but we welcome advice. In particular if it could be possible to include\nfiles from the classpath with wildcards in alphabetical order, we'd be able\nto remove some of the quirks listed above (though at a cost of some complexity!).\n\n\n"},"dev/tips/debugging-remote-brooklyn.html":{"url":"dev/tips/debugging-remote-brooklyn.html","title":"Brooklyn Remote Debugging","keywords":"","body":"Usually during development, you will be running Brooklyn from your IDE (see IDE Setup), in which case\ndebugging is as simple as setting a breakpoint. There may however be times when you need to debug an existing remote\nBrooklyn instance (often referred to as Resident Brooklyn, or rBrooklyn) on another machine, usually in the cloud.\nThankfully, the tools are available to do this, and setting it up is quite straightforward. The steps are as follows:\n\nGetting the right source code version\nStarting Brooklyn with a debug listener\nCreating an SSH tunnel\nConnecting your IDE\n\nGetting the right source code version\nThe first step is to ensure that your local copy of the source code is at the version used to build the remote Brooklyn\ninstance. The git commit that was used to build Brooklyn is available via the REST API:\nhttp://:/v1/server/version\nThis should return details of the build as a JSON string similar to the following (formatted for clarity):\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.13.0-SNAPSHOT\",  {% comment %}BROOKLYN_VERSION{% endcomment %}\n    \"buildSha1\": \"c0fdc15291702281acdebf1b11d431a6385f5224\",\n    \"buildBranch\": \"UNKNOWN\"\n}\n\nThe value that we're interested in is buildSha1. This is the git commit that was used to build Brooklyn. We can now\ncheckout and build the Brooklyn code at this commit by running the following in the root of your Brooklyn repo:\n% git checkout c0fdc15291702281acdebf1b11d431a6385f5224\n% mvn clean install -DskipTests\n\nWhilst building the code isn't strictly necessary, it can help prevent some IDE issues.\nStarting Brooklyn with a debug listener\nBy default, Brooklyn does not listen for a debugger to be attached, however this behaviour can be set by setting JAVA_OPTS,\nwhich will require a restart of the Brooklyn node. To do this, SSH to the remote Brooklyn node and run the following in the\nroot of the Brooklyn installation:\n# NOTE: Running this kill command will lose existing apps and machines if persistence is disabled.\n% kill `cat pid_java`\n% export JAVA_OPTS=\"-Xms256m -Xmx1g -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=127.0.0.1:8888,server=y,suspend=n\"\n% bin/brooklyn launch &\n\nIf JAVA_OPTS is not set, Brooklyn will automatically set it to \"-Xms256m -Xmx1g\", which is why\nwe have prepended the agentlib settings with these values here.\nYou should see the following in the console output:\nListening for transport dt_socket at address: 8888\nThis will indicate the Brooklyn is listening on port 8888 for a debugger to be attached.\nCreating an SSH tunnel\nIf port 8888 is accessible on the remote Brooklyn server, then you can skip this step and simply use the address of the\nserver in place of 127.0.0.1 in the Connecting your IDE section below. It will normally be possible to\nmake the port accessible by configuring Security Groups, iptables, endpoints etc., but for a quick ad-hoc connection it's\nusually simpler to create an SSH tunnel. This will create an open SSH connection that will redirect traffic from a port\non a local interface via SSH to a port on the remote machine. To create the tunnel, run the following on your local\nmachine:\n# replace this with the address or IP of the remote Brooklyn node\nREMOTE_HOST=\n# if you wish to use a different port, this value must match the port specified in the JAVA_OPTS\nREMOTE_PORT=8888 \n# if you wish to use a different local port, this value must match the port specified in the IDE configuration\nLOCAL_PORT=8888 \n# set this to the login user you use to SSH to the remote Brooklyn node\nSSH_USER=root \n# The private key file used to SSH to the remote node. If you use a password, see the alternative command below\nPRIVATE_KEY_FILE=~/.ssh/id_rsa \n\n% ssh -YNf -i $PRIVATE_KEY_FILE -l $SSH_USER -L $LOCAL_PORT:127.0.0.1:$REMOTE_PORT $REMOTE_HOST\n\nIf you use a password to SSH to the remote Brooklyn node, simply remove the -i $PRIVATE_KEY_FILE section like so:\nssh -YNf -l $SSH_USER -L $LOCAL_PORT:127.0.0.1:$REMOTE_PORT $REMOTE_HOST\nIf you are using a password to connect, you will be prompted to enter your password to connect to the remote node upon\nrunning the SSH command.\nThe SSH tunnel should now be redirecting traffic from port 8888 on the local 127.0.0.1 network interface via the SSH \ntunnel to port 8888 on the remote 127.0.0.1 interface. It should now be possible to connect the debugger and start\ndebugging.\n Connecting your IDE\nSetting up your IDE will differ depending upon which IDE you are using. Instructions are given here for Eclipse and\nIntelliJ, and have been tested with Eclipse Luna and IntelliJ Ultimate 14.\nEclipse Setup\nTo debug using Eclipse, first open the Brooklyn project in Eclipse (see IDE Setup).\nNow create a debug configuration by clicking Run | Debug Configurations.... You will then be presented with the \nDebug Configuration dialog.\nSelect Remote Java Application from the list and click the 'New' button to create a new configuration. Set the name\nto something suitable such as 'Remote debug on 8888'. The Project can be set to any of the Brooklyn projects, the \nConnection Type should be set to 'Standard (Socket Attach)'. The Host should be set to either localhost or 127.0.0.1\nand the Port should be set to 8888. Click 'Debug' to start debugging.\nIntelliJ Setup\nTo debug using IntelliJ, first open the Brooklyn project in IntelliJ (see IDE Setup).\nNow create a debug configuration by clicking Run | Edit Configurations. You will then be presented with the\nRun/Debug Configurations dialog.\nClick on the + button and select 'Remote' to create a new remote configuration. Set the name to something suitable\nsuch as 'Remote debug on 8888'. The first three sections simply give the command line arguments for starting the java\nprocess using different versions of java, however we have already done this in \nStarting Brooklyn with a debug listener. The Transport option should be set to 'Socket', the Debugger Mode should be set to 'Attach', the\nHost should be set to localhost or 127.0.0.1 (or the address of the remote machine if you are not using an SSH tunnel),\nand the Port should be set to 8888. The 'Search sources' section should be set to . Click OK to save the\nconfiguration, then select the configuration from the configurations drop-down and click the debug button to start\ndebugging.\nTesting\nThe easiest way to test that remote debugging has been setup correctly is to set a breakpoint and see if it is hit. An\neasy place to start is to create a breakpoint in the ServerResource.java class, in the getStatus() \nmethod. \n"}}}
